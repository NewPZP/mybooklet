#### A: 
Several  years ago, I embarked on an unusual journey to the beautiful region of Patagonia in Argentina. I went with a group of close friends, and we chose this destination <b><u>because of its breathtaking landscapes and unique wildlife</u></b>.<b><u> Instead of opting for the usual tourist activities</u></b>, we decided to<b><u> trek through</u></b> the <b><u>stunning</u></b> Andes Mountains.
The holiday was<b><u> filled with awe-inspiring  moments </u></b>as we navigated through challenging <b><u>terrains</u></b>, encountering  <b><u>diverse flora and fauna</u></b>, What made it truly unusual was our decision to camp in remote areas,<b><u> disconnected from modern amenities</u></b>. We embraced the simplicity of nature, cooking over open fires and sleeping beneath the vast Patagonian sky.
This unconventional holiday stands out because it <b><u>pushed us out of our comfort zones</u></b> and allowed us to<b><u> connect with nature in a profound way</u></b>. The absence of typical tourist attractions made it an extraordinary and memorable experience. 


#### Q: Describe a time when people near you made a lot of noise.
You should say:
Where you heard the noise

#### A:
A few month ago, I found myself in a bustling city square during a lively festival. The noise <b><u>emanated</u></b> from a diverse crowd <b><u>engaged in various activities </u></b>like street performances, live music, and<b><u> vendors promoting their goods</u></b>. Initially, the <b><u>cacophony</u></b> felt overwhelming, but as I embraced the festive spirit, I joined in the celebrations, interacting with the crowd and <b><u>appreciating the vibrant energy around me</u></b>. Despite the initial surprise, I came to enjoy the lively atmosphere, realizing that t<b><u>he collective noise was a testament to community's shared joy and celebration</u></b>.

So, at first, the intensity of the noise was <b><u>startling</u></b>. Navigating through the crowed streets,<b><u> I felt a twinge of annoyance</u></b>, actually, as the sounds merged into a chaotic symphony. However,<b><u> as I immersed myself in the festivities</u></b>, as I said before, my initial irritation<b><u> gave way to</u></b> a growing sense of excitement and community spirit. The shared joy and celebration <b><u>permeating</u></b> the air became infectious.

So, basically, I went from <b><u>being in the kind of frame of  mind</u></b> when I wasn't in the mood for noise at all, to actually <b><u>getting carried away with the spirit of the occasion</u></b>. It just goes to show that sometimes we need to<b><u> shift our mood</u></b> when it comes to moving from one type of activity to another, or one state of mind to another, and I think that's very true when it comes to living in a big city where you are likely to be going from quite places  to noisy places, from stressful places to fun places - you have to learn to be adaptable - and <b><u>that's one of things that stood out that I took away with me that day</u></b>: it's good to be a little bit adaptable.

The Time I helped someone I'd like to talk about was a recent event actually. It was only a week ago. I was on the subway station platform not far from Wang Fu Jing in Beijing, and I saw two elderly foreigners standing looking at a map and <b><u>looking really confused and a bit concerned</u></b>. I thought maybe they spoke English and so I approached them and asked if I could do anything to help. They were very grateful actually, and they were looking for the snack street in Wangfujing, and trying to work out which exit to get out of the subway from. <b><u>I ended up walking with them to the correct exit</u></b>, and then they invited me to join them. They were an American couple on holiday. I showed them the<b><u> snack stalls and fried scorpions</u></b> and other more interesting snacks, then I introduced them to a small restaurant that I thought they would appreciate more. A local Beijing restaurant. We had duck and pancakes and several other simple typical vegetables dishes. I talked to them about my hometown, which is Tianjin, and they told me about their holiday so far. They had been in Guilin and Shanghai before coming to Beijing-they were doing a 3-week tour of China. So, I felt great about this experience and it's lucky I had the free time to not only help them but take them out to dinner and share a meal with them, and good conversation. Also, of course, I got to practice my English!

#### Q: Describe an outdoor activity you did recently.

- Who you did it with
- And explain whether you enjoyed it

An outdoor activity I did recently was on a company <b><u>excursion</u></b> in the countryside. It was really exciting - we learned <b><u>a number of bush craft skills</u></b>. I'm not sure if you know what those are! It's like a sort of survival things - I mean, it's learning sets of skills that might be useful for survival in the wild - but it's made into a fun activity that both adults and young people can do on company excursions or school trips and so on. Bush craft skills are things like learning to cook on an open wood fire you build yourself in the woods, making simple animal traps, learning how to climb trees, make dens and learning which types of plants or wild mushrooms you can eat, and which you cannot. It can be a lot of fun actually - and when we did this with our company, we had a morning learning basic skills from a qualified instructor, then we were divided into teams in the afternoon, and <b><u>had a series of tasks to complete in a given time</u></b>. <b><u>We were then scored points by the instructor on how well we did the task</u></b>. At the very end there was a fairly humorous quiz, then a sort of  assault course in the woods.<b><u> It was a mixture of serious bush craft learning, and basically some fun team-building games, rolled into one</u></b>. I thought it was brilliant, and I had never been to this place in the countryside before (it was a hilly location just outside Chengdu, in a woodland). I asked for help, of course, we had to all ask for help because we worked in teams, and it was part of the team spirit to be open and honest and help each other, and ask for help if we needed to. So, yes, I asked for help. However, during the actual contests in the afternoon, We could not ask for help form the instructor -  but we could ask for help from our team members. I learned a lot from it, and felt that it changed my attitude towards team work, and towards nature in general. It was fun and an educational experience.

Several years back, I <b><u>embarked on a highly anticipated trip</u></b> to Paris, a destination that <b><u>had long occupied the top spot on my travel wish list</u></b>. This journey<b><u> held profound significance for me</u></b> as it <b><u>coincided with the culmination of my master's degree</u></b>. However, <b><u>the intricacies of travel unfolded</u></b>, and trip encountered unexpected delays,<b><u> primarily attributed to</u></b> severe weather conditions disrupting flight schedules.

The delay, although initially <b><u>exasperating</u></b>, unfolded into a unique experience of its own. Stranded at airport, I found myself engaged in conversations with fellow travelers<b><u> facing similar predicaments.</u></b> We<b><u> shared anecdotes, travel aspirations</u></b>, and even discovered common interests. This impromptu camaraderie transformed the delay from an inconvenience into a shared adventure of sorts.

Upon finally arriving in Paris, the initial frustration gave way to a profound sense of gratitude perspective. The delay, while interrupting my carefully planned itinerary, allowed me to<b><u> appreciate the unpredictability of travel </u></b>and <b><u>savor the journey</u></b> itself, beyond the destination. In retrospect, the detour proved to be an unexpected enrichment, demonstrating that the essence of travel often lies in the unscripted moments and connections forged along the way.
