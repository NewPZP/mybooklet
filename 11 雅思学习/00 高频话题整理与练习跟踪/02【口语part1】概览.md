## 问什么
### 职业或家（Work / Home）
- Do you work or are you a student?
	-  I'm working. I'm currently employed at（+公司名）and my job is（+职位名称）.
- Tell me about where you live
	-   I should mention that I live in an apartment（+具体地点）. I've been living there for（+时长）.

### 喜好类
- Do you like animals?
	- Well to be honest, in general I would say that **I'm actually quite keen on**（+类别名词）**,** but in particular I would mention that **I'm really into**（+具体答案词）**.** I guess the reason why **I'm quite a fan of**（+例子）is because I **simply adore**（+原因解释）.
- Do you like reading?
	- Well to be honest, in general I would say that **I'm actually quite keen on**（第1种喜欢表达）reading books, but in particular I would mention that **I'm really into**（第2种喜欢表达）novels like science fictions. I guess the reason why **I'm quite a fan of**（第3种喜欢表达）them is because **I simply adore**（第4种喜欢表达）the **_storyline_**（故事情节）, which is often fairly **_engaging_**（引人入胜）and full of **_twists and turns_**（充满曲折）. Whenever I start to pick up a science fiction, **I'm filled with joy**（第5种喜欢表达）and just can't put it down.
### 讨厌类
- 层次
	- Absolutely, I have to say that I'm disgusted by the weather.（**超级肯定**）  
	- For the most part, I think I'd have to say that I'm not so keen on the weather.（**多半肯定**）  
	- To some extent, I suppose I don't usually find the weather enjoyable.（**大致认为**）  
	- Well, I wouldn't say I'm actually fond of the weather in my hometown.（**轻度否定**）  
	- To be honest, it's hard for me to give a definite answer, in particular the weather in my hometown.（**犹豫不决**）

- Is there anything you don't like about your hometown? 
	- For the most part, I think I'd have to say that **I'm not so keen on**（第1种讨厌表达）the weather. To be specific, **I really can't stand**（第2种讨厌表达）the summer months. This is mainly because the temperature can get as high as 40 degrees and **I find it extremely unpleasant**（第3种讨厌表达）. It can be quite uncomfortable if you don't have air conditioning in your house.

### 频率类
- how often do you go to the cinema?
	- Well to be honest, I think I would have to say that **it really depends.**（首句引出分类讨论）**For example, if** I have the money（第1种情形）, **then** it's quite possible that I will watch a movie in the cinema two or three times a month. **You know** cinema tickets are pretty pricey in China.（解释原因）But **if** I'm broke（第2种情形）, it's more likely that I'll watch movies at home on DVD; **you probably know that** DVDs are quite cheap here, especially compared to the price of a cinema ticket.（引出对比）
- Well, I would have to say that **it really depends**.（引出分类）For example, if...（+第1种情形）, then **it's quite possible that** I will...（+第1个选择）But if（+第2种情形）, then **I will most likely**...（+第2个选择）
- 可替换
	- **If... , then it's almost certain that...**  
	- **If... , then I will invariably...**  
	- **If... , then I guess this will probably...**
