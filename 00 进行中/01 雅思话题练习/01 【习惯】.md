On the other hand, a flexible schedule offers freedom, but may <b><u>lead to delays or missed tasks</u></b>. So for me, it’s best to have a fixed plan with some flexibility when needed, like<b><u> in unexpected situations</u></b>.
		- <b><u>I prefer something in between.</u></b> If everything is too fixed, it gets boring and stressful. But if it’s too flexible, I might<b><u> end up getting nothing done</u></b>. So I usually <b><u>stick to a basic routine</u></b>, but I <b><u>leave room to adjust things</u></b> if <b><u>something urgent comes up</u></b>.
		- While a fixed schedule<b><u> helps me stay disciplined </u></b>and ensures tasks are completed on time, I believe <b><u>too much rigidity can limit creativity and cause burnout</u></b>.

I’ve realized it’s become <b><u>a source of mental fatigue</u></b>.  So, I’ve started taking action by turning off unnecessary notifications, putting my phone out of reach during work time, and even trying<b><u> digital detox days</u></b>. It’s not easy, but I’m slowly<b><u> regaining control over my time</u></b>.
		- Honestly, one habit I really want to change is spending too much time on my phone. I often find myself scrolling through random videos or news feeds without even realizing it. It’s like I’m doing it just out of boredom.  This habit has started to affect my focus, especially when I’m trying to work or study. So now I’m trying to break the habit by replacing it with something more useful, like journaling or going for a walk. I also started using a habit tracker to keep myself accountable. It's still a work in progress, but I think I’m on the right path.
