&#x20; I am form a medium-sized family, I was the youngest child fo three siblings. I think all three of us are quite different.

We certainly have ups and downs, and although we do fall out sometimes, we usually make up.

Unfortunately I don't see a lot of them because I live abroad, but that said, we do stay in touch with Whats app.

Talking about my parents, I take after my Dad, and actually I   am the spitting image of him. I would say, I have my mother's love of cooking, but unfortunately she...

Of course, I am married now and I have been for around 20 years and we have a daughter who is fifteen.

To be honest, my wife and I are like chalk and cheese, but I think it's the differences that make our relationship interesting , and  certainly keep us on our toes.

Between you and me, my wife likes to be in control,  and I think I am mister laid-back.

I am much more relaxed and easy-going, but all in all we compliment each other.

As for my daughter, well she is a mix of both of us in a way, but I would sya undoubtedly, she is much smarter and better looking than the pair of us.
