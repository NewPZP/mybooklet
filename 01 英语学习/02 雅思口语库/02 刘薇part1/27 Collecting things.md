## Do you collect things?
- Yes, sure. Collecting seems to be popular hoppy, especially among people around me. I personally keep a huge collection of books. Though I don't read so much, I'm much quite a bibliophile. Whenever I pass by a vintage bookstore, I would invariably be attracted by the titles and end up with a load of classics, which would hardly read in a couple of years.

## Are there any things you keep from childhood?
- No, probably not. I would say that I'm pretty capricious towards things I collect, so I hardly have anything that I've kept from my childhood. I used to try to collect coins, stamps, CDs and even cassettes, but I <b><u>don't have any clue about</u></b> where they are now.

## Would you keep things for a long time? Why?

## Where do you usually keep things you need?
- I keep them anywhere so I can reach them instantly. I find it quite troublesome to get things I need and put them back in a certain place. That's exactly the reason why my desk and bedroom are usually in a mess. But I'd rather call it an "orderly chaos", becuase I can get what I need without any difficulties.
