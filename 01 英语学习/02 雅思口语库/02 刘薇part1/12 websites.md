## What kinds of websites do you often visit?
- There are three kins of websites I frequently browse: a news and information site such as CCTV. Com, a shopping site such as Taobao. com and a video-sharing site such as  bilibili. Com.  To be honest, there days all these websites have an app that can be installed on our phone, so I bet most people prefer cellphone apps to websites.
## What is your favorite website?
-  Among these websites, my favorite one is the video-sharing site, bilibili. Com . Its videos are mainly themed around ACG, which is the area I am most interest in, Besides, one of the features which attract me most is its scrolling comment. I can post messages on the top of the video during watching, which is really funny.
## Are there any changes to the websites you often visit?
- Yes, just as I mentioned before, bilibili used to be a gathering place for Chinese animation enthusiasts, but now it gradually broadens video types from ACG to fashion, movie, tv-series, music, etc. This change reaches more viewers and it has became the main form of entertainment for Chinese young people.
## What kinds of websites are popular in your country?
- Although a weather site and a news and information site can provide people with the latest news to their daily life, I think sites for entertainment are more popular. When navigating funny pages, people can take a break and recharge their batteries.
