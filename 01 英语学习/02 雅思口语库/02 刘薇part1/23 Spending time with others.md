## Do you like talking with people?
- Yes, I'm a people person so enjoy communicating with people and  making new friends. In fact, I like to strike up conversations with the passengers on the bus when I commute to work on a daily basis. Some people think I'm a weirdo, but I find it quite fun.

##  Ho do you like spending time with your friend?
- I really enjoy spending some quality time with my close friends, like to go shopping to have a cup of latte at my favorite cafe, or to watch a newly released movie in the cinema. I also love playing sports with my friends, such as badminton or tennis. Sometimes we work out together in the gym.

## Would you prefer to study alone or with others?
- To be honest, I'd like to stud alone as  I find it easier to concentrate on the job at hand. I could memorize things or figure out every question<b><u> at my own pace without disturbance</u></b>. However, <b><u>oddly enough</u></b>, there is always something people need to discuss about when studying in groups, or t<b><u>hey just go on idle chi-chat unconsciously</u></b>.

## Do you remember a time when you need to cooperate with others?
- Yes. When I was a student, I needed to work with others in a team for a science project. That was a successful cooperation because we had a trustworthy and level-headed leader who managed the team efficiently. Eventually we done the job pretty well and received respect from other teams.
