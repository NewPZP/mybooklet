## Do you like taking photos?
- Yes, definitely. I find photography a great way to <b><u>record the dribs and drabs of life</u></b>, therefore an album of photos can help us <b><u>recall a lot of sweet and significant moments</u></b>. In addition, a nicely-taken photo can be a piece of art work, which not only provides us with a different angle to look at the world, but probably tells a touching story as well.
## Do you like taking selfies?
- No, I'm afraid not. I've never been enthusiastic about it. Even when I'm doing it, I often feel too embarrassed to<b><u> strike the pose or put on an exaggerative smile</u></b> facing my own phone. Only when I'd asked by my parents or some really close friends would I do it.
## What is your favorite family photo?
- It's the photo that was taken when I was 2 or 3 years old. In the photo, both of my parents are sitting in front of a flowerbed. My mother leans on my father's shoulder, <b><u>while</u></b> my father is holding me in his strong arms. My parents are smiling happily, <b><u>but I seem to be looking at something</u></b> curiously and trying to reach it. The photo <b><u>captured the loving and happy moments </u></b>of my family.
## Do you want to improve your photography skills?

- Yes, <b><u>as long as</u></b> it's not too complicated or takes too much time. It's absolutely <b><u>enviable</u></b> to be good at photography, as we can see that better photography skills often enable people to be more popular. But the fact is that technological advancement <b><u>has indeed been making up </u></b>for the lack of skills. Today there is a wide range of smart cameras that can help us take nicer photos.
