#### feeling bored
- Do you often feel bored?
	- I rarely feel bored, actually. I'm always quite busy - I've got my studies, sporting activities and a fairly busy social calendar. I'm very active person and I never seem to have time for all the things I want to do - so I've certainly no time to get bored.
- What kinds of things would make you feel bored?
	- When I feel bored it's usually when I'm commuting and stuck in traffic. I find traveling by car quite frustrating in big city, and it really affects my mood when there are big traffic jams. So, getting stuck in traffic or moving really slowly in traffic makes me feel both frustrated and bored.
- What would you do if you feel bored?
	- If I feel bored I usually get quite annoyed, and that makes me want to talk to friends to get things off my chest. So, usually I will message my friends or give them a call and talk about my feelings, ask them about their day, gossip about daily life... things like this. This kind of thing usually relieves my boredom and frustration temporarily.
- Do you think childhood is boring or adulthood is boring?
	- I believe both childhood and adulthood have their share of interesting and mundane moments. Childhood might seem simpler, but adulthood offers diverse experiences and responsibilities. Boredom is subjective, varying from person to person.
