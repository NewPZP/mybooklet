### Crowded places
- Is the city where you live crowded?
	- The city I reside in is consistently buzzing with activity, and there are lots of crowed areas. Some areas are crowed in a way that really bug me - like subway station and malls. But there are also some cool crowded places like clubs and restaurants, which have a good atmosphere when busy.
- Is there a crowded place near where you live?
	- Generally speaking my area of the city is relatively quite, but there's a lively market near my home that's always bustling with people, and if you're in the right mood the energy there is contagious and optimistic.
- Do you like crowed places?
	- Crowed places evoke mixed feelings in me. While they offer a vibrant atmosphere, the hustle and bustle can be overwhelming, especially when you're in a rush, busy or trying to get from one place to another by public transport hubs.
- When was the last time you were in a crowed place?
	- I recently found myself in a bustling place during a local festival, enjoying the lively atmosphere and diverse activities. It was a temple fair - and they are always more exciting when they're busy.
