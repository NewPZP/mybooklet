#### A:
- The place where I go where I can really relax is the local park. I am lucky enough to live really close to a nice park - in fact, it's a great park - and it's free to get in! It's got a huge lake and a number of wonderful gardens with trees, plants, flowers, and <b><u>areas for old and young people to do recreational activities.</u></b> There is also a cafe and a restaurant in the park, as well as boats on the lake, tennis courts, and a children's play area. I go there almost every weekend, and although it is really popular park, there are always quiet areas where you can sit alone on a stone bench or at a little table. During the summer months I go there regularly to read and study and just walk around and <b><u>clear my head</u></b>. I feel great when I'm there and I enjoy the fact that there is peace and quite there, as well as activities that people can do. It's a  fantastic environment to be in - and<b><u> the park is really well-tended and look after</u></b>. It's an ideal place for individuals like me who want to go alone and get some fresh air and enjoy a natural space, as well as families who want to take their kids out to enjoy the activities available there.
