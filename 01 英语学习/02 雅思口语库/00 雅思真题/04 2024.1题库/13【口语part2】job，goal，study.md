#### Q: Describe a job you don't want to do in the future.
You should say:
- What it is
- Where you knew if from
- Why you think it is difficulty or easy
- And explain why you don't want to do it
#### A :
There are lots of jobs that I wouldn't want to do! But I think the worst of those would be a bus diver in a big city. I hate traffic. I really hate traffic in cities here - there are too many people, too much cars and too many bad drivers to be honest. I really do not like being in traffic here, so <b><u>I cannot imagine how stressful it would be</u></b> to actually be driving a bus all day long as a job.<b><u> It would be my idea of a living nightmare!</u></b>

I know about the job because everyone is aware of this, it's common profession, it's not a strange or bizarre job. I think it's difficult job because<b><u> it involves a massive test of one's patience</u></b>. Also, it's tiring driving  a bus all day. I actually drive a car and I find that really tiring after just an hour in this traffic, so I cannot imagine how tiring it would be to driving all day every day -  especially something big like a bus - you have to pay very close attention to the road and be constantly aware of really bad drivers all around and ahead of you. I'd hate it, I really would hate it with a passion. I feel very sorry for city bus drivers, and I sincerely admire their patience!


#### Q: Describe a life-longe goal you would like to achieve.
You should say:
- What the goal is
- How long you have had this goal
- How you will achieve it 
- And explain why you set this goal
#### A:
One of my life-long goals is to establish a foundation focused on promoting education and literacy i<b><u>n underprivileged communities</u></b>. <b><u>This aspiration has been ingrained in me for as long as I can remember</u></b>, originating from personal experiences and a deep belief in the transformative power of education.

The goal to create such a foundation has been with me since my college days, where I witnessed firsthand the disparities in educational opportunities. Over the years, this goal has evolved and solidified, fueled by a growing understanding of the profound impact eduction has on individuals and communities.

To achieve this goal, I plan to start small by collaborating with local schools and communities, implementing programs that address specific educational challenges. As the foundation grows, I envision expanding its reach and impact, incorporating technology to make education more accessible and tailored to the needs of each community.

T<b><u>he motivation behind this goal stems form a belief </u></b>that education is the cornerstone of personal and societal progress. Having been fortunate enough to receive quality education, I feel a sense of responsibility to contribute to creating similar opportunities for others. Witnessing the transformative effect education can have on individuals motivates me to work towards providing those opportunities to those who might not have easy access.

In essence, this life-long goal is not just about establishing an organization; it's about being a catalyst for positive change and empowerment through education. It represents my commitment to contributing to a more equitable and enlightened world, where everyone, regardless of their background, has the chance to unlock their full potential.


#### Q: Describe  something that helps you focus on work or study.
You should say:
- What it is 
- How often you do it
- When you start doing it
- And explain how it helps you concentrate

What really helps me focus on my studies is classical musical - light classical music. I always<b><u> put violin or cello music on</u></b> when I am studying, or clarinet music. I don't put it on loudly. I just<b><u> put it on in the background</u></b>, and I choose really calm concertos and pieces of music that are not too fast or too erratic. This <b><u>helps my mind detach from the stresses and strains of daily life</u></b>, and  helps to make my thought calm and focused. It's a habit I've had for many years, which started, I think, when I was in high school, and a teacher recommended it. I began doing it in my dorm at university almost every time I had to study and I found it worked wonderfully. In those days I used to listen to music on headphones, because I shared the dorm with others, but now I have my own room. I play it on speakers from my computer. I am a person who needs to be a quiet place when I am studying -  a place where I cannot hear the sound of traffic on the roads or anything like this - so putting on calming, relaxing classical music an also <b><u>help to drown out of the sound of the city </u></b>that might come in though the window. So, yeah, this is my main method of concentrating and relaxing when I really need to focus on studies and shut out the outside world.
