# IELTS Speaking Practice: Colour-related Questions

## 1. What is your favourite colour?

1. As a programmer who spends countless hours staring at screens, I find myself drawn to soothing shades of blue. It reminds me of the clear skies over my childhood village in Wenzhou, providing a sense of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of city life. Interestingly, this preference for blue has subtly influenced my coding style, as I often use blue-themed syntax highlighting in my integrated development environment.

2. My favourite colour is actually a vibrant shade of green, reminiscent of the lush bamboo forests surrounding my hometown in rural Wenzhou. This preference has stayed with me even as I've transitioned into the world of technology, serving as a constant reminder of my roots. I find that incorporating touches of green in my workspace helps me stay grounded and focused during long coding sessions.

3. Given my penchant for sports like badminton and table tennis, it's perhaps unsurprising that I'm particularly fond of crisp, clean white. This colour not only reminds me of the lines on a badminton court but also symbolizes the blank slate I hope to have when I eventually transition to freelance work. White represents to me the potential for new beginnings and the clarity of thought I strive for in both my athletic pursuits and my programming career.

4. I've always been drawn to the colour red, which might seem at odds with my calm demeanour as a programmer. However, in Chinese culture, red symbolizes good fortune and joy, reminding me of festive celebrations in my Wenzhou village. This vibrant hue energizes me during my morning jogs and skipping routines, and even inspires me to tackle challenging coding problems with renewed vigour.

5. My favourite colour is a deep, rich purple, which I believe reflects my journey from a simple rural upbringing to a complex urban life. Purple, traditionally associated with royalty and luxury, represents to me the aspirations I have for my career, including my dream of becoming a successful freelancer. It's a colour that bridges the gap between my humble beginnings and my ambitious future, much like how I strive to balance traditional values with modern technology in my daily life.

## 2. Are there any colours that have a special meaning in your culture?

1. In Chinese culture, red holds immense significance, symbolizing good fortune, joy, and prosperity. Growing up in Wenzhou, I vividly remember the prevalence of red during festivals and celebrations, from the vibrant decorations to the crimson envelopes containing money gifts. This cultural association has stayed with me even in my professional life as a programmer, where I often find myself gravitating towards red when designing user interfaces for good luck.

2. While red is undoubtedly important, yellow also carries special meaning in our culture, representing royalty and power. In my hometown in Wenzhou, yellow was often used in traditional architecture, symbolizing the earth and the emperor. As a programmer, I find it interesting how these cultural colour associations sometimes influence design choices in software development, especially when creating applications for a Chinese audience.

3. In contrast to the vibrant reds and yellows, white holds a more solemn meaning in Chinese culture, often associated with mourning and funerals. However, it's fascinating to see how this perception is slowly changing, particularly in urban areas where I now work. In the tech industry, for instance, white is frequently used to convey cleanliness and simplicity in user interface design, showcasing how traditional colour meanings can evolve in a modern context.

4. Green has always held a special place in our culture, symbolizing growth, harmony, and health. Coming from a rural area in Wenzhou, I grew up surrounded by lush green fields, which instilled in me a deep appreciation for this colour. Now, as a programmer aspiring to be a freelancer, I often incorporate green into my work environment to promote balance and well-being, especially during long coding sessions.

5. In Chinese culture, blue is not traditionally as significant as other colours, but it has gained importance in recent years, particularly in urban areas. As someone who's made the transition from a small village to a big city, I've noticed how blue has come to represent technology, innovation, and progress. This shift in perception aligns well with my career in programming and my frequent use of blue-light filtering glasses to protect my eyes during long hours of coding.

## 3. Do you usually wear clothes in your favourite colour?

1. While I do appreciate my favourite colour, as a programmer, I tend to prioritize comfort and practicality in my daily wardrobe. However, I often incorporate subtle touches of my preferred hue through accessories like ties or socks, which add a personal flair to my otherwise neutral office attire. This balance allows me to maintain a professional appearance while still expressing my individuality.

2. Given my background growing up in rural Wenzhou and my current position in a tech company, my clothing choices tend to be a blend of traditional and modern styles. While I don't exclusively wear my favourite colour, I do enjoy incorporating it into casual wear, especially when engaging in sports like badminton or table tennis. It's a way for me to bring a bit of personal joy into my active lifestyle, which helps balance out the long hours I spend sitting at a computer.

3. As someone aspiring to become a freelancer, I'm conscious of the importance of personal branding. While I don't always wear clothes in my favourite colour, I do make a point of incorporating it into my wardrobe for networking events or client meetings. This consistent colour choice has become a subtle part of my professional identity, helping me stand out in the competitive tech industry while still maintaining a polished appearance.

4. To be honest, my favourite colour doesn't feature prominently in my everyday wardrobe. Coming from a small village in Wenzhou, I learned the value of practicality in clothing choices, a habit that has stuck with me even as I've adapted to city life. However, I do enjoy wearing my favourite colour during festive occasions or when participating in team-building activities at work, as it helps me feel more connected to my roots and personal identity.

5. As someone who enjoys sports like jogging and skipping rope, my clothing choices are often dictated by functionality rather than colour preference. That said, I do own several workout outfits in my favourite hue, which I find gives me an extra boost of motivation during exercise. Interestingly, this pop of colour in my fitness routine provides a refreshing contrast to the more muted tones I typically wear in the office, helping me mentally transition between work and personal time.

## 4. What is your preferred car colour for purchase?

1. As a programmer with a penchant for logic and efficiency, I'm drawn to silver cars for their practical benefits. Silver not only maintains a clean appearance for longer, reducing the need for frequent washes, but it also has good visibility on the road, enhancing safety. Moreover, silver cars often have a higher resale value, which appeals to my forward-thinking nature as someone aspiring to be a freelancer.

2. Given my rural upbringing in Wenzhou, I have a soft spot for earthy tones when it comes to cars. A deep forest green, for instance, would be my top choice as it reminds me of the lush countryside of my childhood while still looking sophisticated in an urban setting. This colour choice reflects my desire to maintain a connection to my roots even as I navigate the fast-paced world of technology.

3. As someone who enjoys the thrill of roller coasters, I'm surprisingly inclined towards more subdued car colours. A classic white, for example, appeals to me for its clean, timeless look. It also has practical benefits, such as better heat reflection, which is particularly useful during my weekend badminton or table tennis sessions when the car is parked under the sun for hours.

4. Interestingly, despite my cautious nature as a programmer, I'm drawn to bold, attention-grabbing colours for cars. A vibrant red, for instance, not only stands out in a sea of neutral-toned vehicles but also embodies the energy and passion I hope to bring to my future freelance career. Plus, it's a nod to the auspicious nature of red in Chinese culture, which resonates with my Wenzhou heritage.

5. As someone who values both tradition and innovation, I find myself leaning towards a sleek black for my ideal car colour. Black not only exudes sophistication and professionalism, which aligns with my career in the tech industry, but it also symbolizes power and prestige in many cultures. Furthermore, the timeless elegance of a black car mirrors my approach to programming: creating solutions that are both classic in their efficiency and modern in their application.
