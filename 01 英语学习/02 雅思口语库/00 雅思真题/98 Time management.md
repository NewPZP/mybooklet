### How do you plan your time in a day?
- Personally, I make to-do lists in an app that can be synchronized between mobile and PC, so that they can be easily adjusted to keep me on track anywhere, anytime. Therefore, my work and leisure time are well-balanced.
### Is it easy to manage time for you?
- As a software engineer in a large company, managing time is challenging due to unpredictable workloads and frequent team collaborations. I often struggle with prioritizing tasks despite using tools like to-do lists. To improve, I'm setting more realistic goals and breaking tasks into smaller steps. Though it's a work in progress, I hope these strategies will enhance my time management.
