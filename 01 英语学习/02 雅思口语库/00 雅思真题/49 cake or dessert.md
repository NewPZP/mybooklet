## 1. Do you like cakes or desserts?

1. As someone who grew up in a small village in Wenzhou,<b><u> my taste buds have always leaned towards our local delicacies rather than Western-style cakes.</u></b> However, the fast-paced life of a programmer in a big city has introduced me to a variety of desserts that I've come to appreciate. I particularly enjoy light, fruity desserts that offer a refreshing break from hours of staring at code. <b><u>That being said, nothing beats the nostalgia of traditional Wenzhou sweet treats</u></b>, especially when I'm feeling homesick after a long day at work.

2. To be honest, as a health-conscious individual with a regular skipping and jogging routine, I try to limit my intake of sugary foods. However, I do have a soft spot for certain desserts, particularly those that incorporate fresh, seasonal fruits. I find that these lighter options provide a nice energy boost during long coding sessions without the guilt associated with heavier, cream-based cakes. Interestingly, my preference for fruity desserts aligns well with my dream of becoming a freelancer, as they offer a quick, refreshing treat that doesn't induce a food coma and hinder productivity.

3. Growing up in a rural area of Wenzhou, cakes and Western-style desserts were not a common part of my childhood diet. However, since moving to the city and working in a large tech company, I've developed quite a fondness for them. I especially enjoy desserts that blend Eastern and Western elements, like matcha tiramisu or red bean cheesecake. These fusion desserts remind me of my own journey, bridging the gap between my rural roots and urban lifestyle, much like how I balance traditional values with modern ambitions in my career.

4. As someone who's always on the go, juggling a demanding programming job with my passion for sports like badminton and table tennis, I tend to gravitate towards quick, bite-sized desserts rather than large slices of cake. I find that small, individually portioned treats like macarons or mochi provide a perfect sweet fix without weighing me down. Plus, these portable desserts are ideal for snacking on during short breaks between coding sprints, helping me maintain my energy levels throughout the day.

5. While I do enjoy the occasional dessert, my palate, shaped by years of savoring Wenzhou's unique cuisine, often finds Western cakes too sweet for my liking. Instead, I prefer our local desserts, especially those with subtle, complex flavors like osmanthus jelly or pumpkin pancakes. These traditional treats not only satisfy my sweet tooth but also connect me to my roots, providing a moment of calm amidst the chaotic life of a big city programmer. Interestingly, I find that the precision required in making these delicate desserts mirrors the attention to detail needed in coding, reminding me of the artistry in both culinary and digital creations.

## 2. Why do some people not like eating sweet food?

1. As a programmer who spends long hours in front of a computer, I've noticed that excessive sugar intake can lead to energy crashes, which is detrimental to maintaining focus during coding sessions. This experience has made me more mindful of my sugar consumption, and I believe many others in high-intensity jobs might feel the same way. Additionally, growing up in a small Wenzhou village, our local cuisine often emphasized savory flavors over sweet ones, which might have influenced my palate. I think cultural background and dietary habits formed in childhood play a significant role in shaping one's preference for or aversion to sweet foods.

2. From my perspective as someone who regularly engages in sports like badminton and table tennis, I've become acutely aware of how different foods affect my performance. Sweet foods, while providing a quick energy boost, often lead to a rapid drop in blood sugar levels, which can negatively impact my game. Moreover, as I've gotten older and more health-conscious, I've started paying more attention to the potential long-term effects of excessive sugar consumption, such as increased risk of diabetes and obesity. I believe many people, especially those leading active lifestyles or with health concerns, might avoid sweet foods for similar reasons.

3. In my experience transitioning from a rural upbringing to a fast-paced urban lifestyle, I've observed that stress and anxiety can significantly alter one's taste preferences. The demanding nature of my programming job often leaves me craving savory, comforting foods rather than sweets. Additionally, the constant exposure to artificial sweeteners in many processed foods has made some people, myself included, more sensitive to and less tolerant of overly sweet flavors. I think this flavor fatigue, combined with increased awareness of the health implications of high sugar intake, contributes to some individuals' aversion to sweet foods.

4. As someone dreaming of becoming a freelancer in the tech industry, I've been paying close attention to how different foods affect my productivity and mental clarity. I've noticed that consuming too many sweets can lead to difficulty in concentrating, which is crucial in my line of work. Furthermore, having grown up speaking Wenzhou dialect, I'm particularly attuned to how language and culture shape our food preferences. In many Asian cultures, including parts of China, traditional medicine often associates excessive sweetness with imbalance in the body, which might explain why some people instinctively avoid overly sweet foods.

5. From my observations as both a tech professional and a sports enthusiast, I've noticed that people's aversion to sweet foods can stem from a variety of factors. Some individuals might have had negative experiences, such as cavities or weight gain, which they associate with consuming too many sweets. Others, particularly those in high-stress environments like the tech industry, might find that sugar exacerbates anxiety or mood swings. Additionally, as our understanding of nutrition evolves, many people are becoming more conscious of hidden sugars in processed foods, leading them to be more cautious about their overall sugar intake. This increased awareness, coupled with personal health goals, can contribute to a reduced preference for sweet foods.
