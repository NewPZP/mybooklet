## 1. Do you play video games?

1. As a programmer, I find myself drawn to video games not just for entertainment, but also as a way to unwind after long hours of coding. The logical puzzles and problem-solving aspects of many games resonate with my professional mindset, offering a refreshing change of pace from my daily work. However, I'm cautious not to let gaming interfere with my regular exercise routine of skipping rope and jogging, which I find essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

2. While I do enjoy the occasional gaming session, I have to admit that my rural upbringing in Wenzhou has instilled in me a preference for more traditional pastimes. That being said, I find certain strategy games fascinating, as they often require the same kind of analytical thinking I use in my programming work. Balancing my gaming hobby with my career aspirations and fitness regimen can be challenging, but I believe it's all about moderation and making conscious choices about how I spend my leisure time.

3. To be honest, video games were not a significant part of my childhood in the Wenzhou countryside, but I've grown to appreciate them since moving to the city and working in the tech industry. I particularly enjoy games that challenge my problem-solving skills or offer a social component, allowing me to connect with colleagues and friends. However, I'm mindful of not letting gaming consume too much of my time, as I'm focused on advancing my career and working towards my goal of becoming a freelancer.

4. As someone who's experienced the adrenaline rush of roller coasters, I find that certain action-packed video games can provide a similar thrill without the physical risks. That said, I'm quite selective about the games I play, preferring those that offer mental stimulation or help me unwind after a stressful day of programming. I often find myself drawing parallels between game design and software development, which adds an extra layer of appreciation to my gaming experiences.

5. Coming from a small village in Wenzhou, video games were once a novelty to me, but they've become an interesting way to bridge my rural roots with my current urban lifestyle. I enjoy games that incorporate elements of Chinese culture or language, as they help me stay connected to my heritage while engaging in a modern form of entertainment. However, I'm careful to balance my gaming time with other activities, such as playing badminton or table tennis, to ensure I maintain a well-rounded lifestyle.

## 2. What kinds of video games do you like to play?

1. Given my background in programming, I'm particularly drawn to puzzle and strategy games that challenge my problem-solving skills. Games like "Portal" or "Factorio" appeal to my love for logical thinking and efficient system design, mirroring the challenges I face in my day job. Additionally, I enjoy management simulation games that allow me to exercise the organizational skills I hope to use when I eventually become a freelancer.

2. As someone who grew up in rural Wenzhou, I find myself gravitating towards games that offer a connection to nature or rural life, such as farming simulators or open-world exploration games. These provide a nostalgic escape from my busy urban life as a programmer. However, I also enjoy fast-paced sports games like virtual badminton or table tennis, which allow me to indulge in my favorite physical activities even when I can't make it to the court.

3. Coming from a background where traditional games were more common, I've developed a fondness for digital versions of classic Chinese games like Mahjong or Go. These games not only entertain but also help me maintain a connection to my cultural roots. On the flip side, I'm also fascinated by futuristic sci-fi games that showcase advanced technologies, as they often inspire me to think creatively about potential innovations in my own field of work.

4. As a programmer with aspirations of freelancing, I'm drawn to multiplayer games that foster teamwork and communication skills. Games like "Overcooked" or "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" are not only entertaining but also help me hone skills that are valuable in collaborative work environments. Additionally, I enjoy games with robust modding communities, as they allow me to experiment with game development and coding in a fun, low-pressure environment.

5. Given my penchant for physical activities like jogging and skipping rope, I've found myself increasingly drawn to fitness-oriented games and VR experiences. These games allow me to combine my love for technology with my commitment to staying active. However, I also enjoy narrative-driven games that offer rich storytelling experiences, particularly those that explore themes of personal growth and career development, as they often resonate with my own journey from a small village to a big city tech career.

## 3. Is it good for young people to play video games?

1. As someone who's navigated the transition from rural life to a career in technology, I believe video games can be beneficial for young people when approached mindfully. They can foster problem-solving skills, enhance digital literacy, and even provide a platform for social interaction in our increasingly connected world. However, it's crucial to balance gaming with other activities, such as sports and outdoor pursuits, to ensure a well-rounded development.

2. From my perspective as a programmer, I see both potential benefits and risks in young people playing video games. On one hand, many games can enhance cognitive skills, strategic thinking, and even introduce basic programming concepts, which could be valuable in our technology-driven future. On the other hand, excessive gaming could lead to a sedentary lifestyle, potentially impacting physical health and social skills. The key lies in moderation and parental guidance to ensure a healthy balance.

3. Drawing from my experience of growing up in a small Wenzhou village and later adapting to city life, I believe video games can serve as a bridge between traditional and modern ways of learning and socializing for young people. Games can offer exposure to diverse cultures, languages, and ideas, broadening horizons in ways that weren't possible for previous generations. However, it's essential to complement this digital exposure with real-world experiences and physical activities to ensure holistic development.

4. As someone who dreams of becoming a freelancer, I can see how certain video games might help young people develop valuable skills for the future job market. Games that encourage creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration could foster entrepreneurial thinking and adaptability. Nevertheless, it's crucial to teach young people to approach gaming critically, understanding both its entertainment value and its limitations as a learning tool.

5. Having experienced the thrill of roller coasters and the joy of sports like badminton, I believe it's important for young people to have a diverse range of experiences beyond video games. While games can offer cognitive benefits and even simulate physical activities, they shouldn't replace real-world adventures and face-to-face interactions. The ideal approach would be to integrate gaming as part of a balanced lifestyle that includes outdoor activities, sports, and social engagements, ensuring young people develop into well-rounded individuals.
