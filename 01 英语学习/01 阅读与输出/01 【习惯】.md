Then I would have my breakfast quickly or just eat nothing. After that I need to spend more than an hour commuting to work because of the terrible traffic.
	优化： 
	- I usually wake up at around 6 a.m. and start my morning by doing some light reading, often TED articles that I find interesting. Then I either go jogging or skip rope to get my body moving and boost my energy for the day. After that, I take a quick shower, grab a fast breakfast—or sometimes skip it—and then spend over an hour commuting to work due to the heavy traffic in Hangzhou.
	- I wake up at around 6 in the morning and <b><u>begin my day with a bit of stretching or jogging</u></b>. Then I wash up and r<b><u>ead something inspiring, usually TED articles</u></b>.

	- Yes，I follow the same routing on workdays, I usually get up early around 6:30 am and do some exercises like jogging or stretching, then I'll get washed, and grab a quick bite or skip breakfast altogether, and brace myself for long commute to work. But in weekends, It all depends, I may go out for camping with my family or just stay in my room, play video games all day.
	优化：
	- Yes, I usually follow the same routine on weekdays. I wake up around 6:30 a.m., do some light exercises like jogging or stretching, then wash up and either grab a quick breakfast or skip it altogether. After that, I prepare for the long commute to work. However, on weekends, my schedule is more flexible. I might go camping with my family or just stay in and spend the day playing video games.
	- Yeah, <b><u>I pretty much stick to the same routine</u></b> on weekdays. I get up early, <b><u>work out a bit</u></b>, then head to work. But on weekends, it really depends—I might go camping with my family or<b><u> just chill at home</u></b> playing video games.
	- Yes,<b><u> I do follow a set routine during workdays</u></b>. I usually get up at 6:30 a.m., <b><u>exercise for a while</u></b>, get ready, and leave for work after a quick breakfast—or sometimes none at all. The commute takes over an hour. On weekends,<b><u> though, things are more relaxed.</u></b> I might go on a short trip with my family or simply stay home and enjoy some gaming time.
	- For weekdays, <b><u>I follow a fairly strict routine</u></b>. I’m <b><u>up by 6:30,</u></b> do some stretching or jogging, <b><u>get cleaned up,</u></b> have a light breakfast—or skip it—and then <b><u>face a long commute due to heavy traffic</u></b>. But on weekends,<b><u> my schedule is more spontaneous</u></b>. I might go camping with my family if the weather's nice, or just <b><u>unwind at home and spend the day gaming</u></b>.
    
4. Are you a creature of habit?
	- Not really，but I do follow a set of routine during weekdays. I get up early, work out a bit ,then head to work which will take me more than hour. I also do some english practices during lunch break. The routine make me feel exhausted, but I need the work to support my family. I would like my life more flexible if I could.
	- 优化
		- Yes, <b><u>I’d say I am a creature of habit</u></b>, especially on weekdays. I wake up around 6:30, do some morning exercises, then head to work, which takes over an hour due to traffic. I also try to squeeze in some English practice during lunch. Having a routine helps me stay productive and gives structure to my day, even though it can be tiring sometimes.
		- Not really. I do follow a routine on workdays out of necessity, like waking up early, exercising, and commuting. But to be honest, I don't enjoy living by a fixed schedule. I prefer having the freedom to decide what to do based on how I feel. That’s why I love weekends—they give me space to relax and be spontaneous.
		- <b><u>I wouldn't call myself a creature of habit</u></b>, but my job <b><u>kind of forces me into a routine</u></b>. I get up early, do a bit of exercise, and then spend over an hour commuting. I even practice English during lunch breaks to improve myself. <b><u>Honestly, this routine can be exhausting</u></b>, but <b><u>I have to stick with it to support my family</u></b>. If I had more freedom, <b><u>I’d love a more flexible lifestyle</u></b>.
    
5. What’s a habit you have that helps you stay productive?
	- Go to bed early and have a good sleep helps me stay productive mostly, so I usually do some preparation before go do bed, like stretching. And regular exercise in morning would boost my energy but not too often
	- 优化
		- I’d say getting a good night’s sleep is the key for me. I usually go to bed early, and before that, I like to <b><u>stretch a bit to help me wind down</u></b>. I also try to work out in the morning—it’s a great way to <b><u>wake up my body and mind</u></b>, though I don’t do it every single day.
		- <b><u>Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule</u></b> really improves my productivity. I typically go to bed early and do some light stretching beforehand to help me unwind. Morning exercise is another helpful habit—it<b><u> enhances my concentration</u></b> and<b><u> keeps my energy levels stable</u></b> throughout the day.
    
6. Have your habits changed in recent years?
	- I changed me job two years ago so I would take more than an hour on commuting to my company, that cost much of my free time so that now I rarely do physical exercise now, which lead to my over weight
	- 优化
		- Yes, my habits have definitely changed. I changed my job two years ago, and now it takes me over an hour to commute to work. This<b><u> eats up a lot of my free time,</u></b> so I rarely exercise these days, and as a result, I’ve gained some weight.
		- Yeah, they’ve changed quite a bit. I started a new job two years ago, and the long commute—over an hour each way—<b><u>really takes up my free time.</u></b> I used to work out a lot, but now I barely exercise, and I’ve<b><u> put on some weight </u></b>because of that.
		- Absolutely. Since <b><u>switching jobs two</u></b> years ago, my <b><u>daily commute has increased to</u></b> over an hour. This has<b><u> significantly reduced the time I have for physical activity,</u></b> and unfortunately, I’ve become less active and gained some weight as a result.
    
7. Do you prefer having a fixed schedule or a flexible one?
	- A fixed schedule may make me feel boring, but a flexible one may make my plan failed, the key is to maintain a balance between them. The most priority must have a fixed schedule, and flexible should be made due to some emergencies
	- 优化
		- I think both fixed and flexible schedules<b><u> have their pros and cons</u></b>. A fixed schedule helps me stay organized and productive, but it can feel a bit boring at times. On the other hand, a flexible schedule offers freedom, but may <b><u>lead to delays or missed tasks</u></b>. So for me, it’s best to have a fixed plan with some flexibility when needed, like<b><u> in unexpected situations</u></b>.
		- <b><u>I prefer something in between.</u></b> If everything is too fixed, it gets boring and stressful. But if it’s too flexible, I might<b><u> end up getting nothing done</u></b>. So I usually <b><u>stick to a basic routine</u></b>, but I <b><u>leave room to adjust things</u></b> if <b><u>something urgent comes up</u></b>.
		- While a fixed schedule<b><u> helps me stay disciplined </u></b>and ensures tasks are completed on time, I believe <b><u>too much rigidity can limit creativity and cause burnout</u></b>. That’s why I prefer <b><u>a structured routine with built-in flexibility</u></b>. This way, I can <b><u>stay on track</u></b> while <b><u>still adapting to unexpected changes or emergencies</u></b>.
    
8. What time do you usually wake up?
	- I usually wake up before 7 a.m. since I cost more than an hour in commuting  on weekdays, but on weekends, I depends, I may get up early and prepare a good breakfast for my family, or just sleep until I feel it's enough
	- 优化
		- I usually wake up before 7 a.m. on weekdays because <b><u>my commute takes over an hour</u></b>. On weekends, it depends. Sometimes I get up early to make breakfast for my family, but other times I sleep in and <b><u>rest as much as I need.</u></b>
		- During the week, I typically get up before 7 a.m. <b><u>as my daily commute takes over an hour</u></b>. <b><u>However, on weekends, my schedule is more relaxed.</u></b> I might wake up early to prepare breakfast for my family, or<b><u> simply sleep in to catch up on rest</u></b>.
    
9. Do you think it’s important to have a routine?
	- Yes , I think it's important, especially if you have some goals, like maintaining you heath, improving some skills, etc. Take me as an example, I need to practice english everyday, or I won't pass ILTES test forever, a long distant destination begins with steps.
	- 优化
		- Yes, I believe having a routine is important, especially when you have specific goals. For example, I’m currently preparing for the IELTS exam, so I need to practice English every day. Without a routine, it’s easy to lose focus and fall behind.
		- Definitely. If you want to achieve something—like learning a language or staying healthy—you need a routine to keep yourself on track. I try to study English every day so I can improve steadily and hopefully pass the IELTS soon.
		- Yes, I think routines<b><u> are essential for achieving long-term goals</u></b>. Personally, I’m aiming to pass the IELTS exam, so I make it a habit to study English every day. <b><u>As the saying goes</u></b>, “<b><u>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</u></b>”
		
10. Do you enjoy trying new things or sticking to your habits?
	-  Trying new things and sticking to habits both have their pros and cons. If you always trying new things and don't form a habits, you will never learn something deeply, however, if you sticking to some habits and never try new things, you may miss the chance to become more efficient. I think It's good to have a habit to trying some new things sometimes and replace the old habits when you find it's more efficient. 
	- 优化
		- I enjoy both trying new things and sticking to my habits, depending on the situation. Habits <b><u>help me stay organized and consistent</u></b>, but trying new things keeps life interesting and helps me grow. I believe it's important <b><u>to strike a balance</u></b>—<b><u>stick to good habits, but be open to change when something better comes along.</u></b>
		- I think sticking to habits provides stability, <b><u>while</u></b> trying new things fosters creativity and innovation. If we never<b><u> step out of our comfort zone</u></b>, we might miss out on more efficient or enjoyable ways of doing things. Personally, I try to maintain my core routines but always <b><u>stay open to new experiences</u></b> that could improve my life.
		- It really depends! I like having habits because they make my life feel more organized, but I also get bored easily, so I enjoy trying new things from time to time. Sometimes I even replace old habits when I find something more fun or effective.
    
11. What’s your typical evening routine?
	- There is barely evening time I can handle freely, I almost spend it on commuting home, or working over time. Occasionally, I would take a walk in my company zone, where has a pond and some black swans in it 
	- 优化
		- I hardly have any free time in the evening because I spend most of it commuting or working overtime.<b><u> However, when I do get a break</u></b>, I enjoy taking a walk around my office area, which has a beautiful pond with a few black swans. <b><u>It helps me </u></b>relax after a long day.
		- Most of my evenings <b><u>are taken up by </u></b>commuting home or finishing up work.<b><u> But if I’m lucky and finish early</u></b>, I like walking around the office park. There’s a small pond there with some black swans—really peaceful!
		- Usually, I don’t have much free time in the evenings<b><u> because of long commutes and occasional overtime</u></b>. But <b><u>on lighter days</u></b>, I try to <b><u>unwind by taking a short walk near my workplace</u></b>. There’s a lovely pond nearby with black swans, and it helps me clear my mind.
