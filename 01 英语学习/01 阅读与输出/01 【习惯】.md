		Yes, I'm an early bird, I usually get up before 7 am, start my new day with some physically exercises, make myself energetic whole day. Then, I'll spend more than an hour to commute to my company cause that terrible traffic in Hanzhou on workdays. During lunch breaks, I may spend one hour to practice my english. 
	优化：
		Yes, I do. I'm an early bird, so I usually get up before 7 a.m. I like to start my day with some light physical exercise,<b><u> such as</u></b> jogging or stretching, <b><u>which helps me stay energetic throughout the day</u></b>. After that, I spend more than an hour commuting to work because of the terrible traffic in Hangzhou during weekdays. During my lunch break, I often spend around an hour practicing English to improve my language skills.
    
2. What’s your morning routine like?
	原：
		 I do some reading or some physical exercise in the morning after getting up at around 6 a.m. After washing, I usually read TED articles, and jogging or jump rope is an option to start my energetic day. Then I would have my breakfast quickly or just eat nothing. After that I need to spend more than an hour commuting to work because of the terrible traffic.
	优化： 
	- I usually wake up at around 6 a.m. and start my morning by doing some light reading, often TED articles that I find interesting. Then I either go jogging or skip rope to get my body moving and boost my energy for the day. After that, I take a quick shower, grab a fast breakfast—or sometimes skip it—and then spend over an hour commuting to work due to the heavy traffic in Hangzhou.
	- I wake up at around 6 in the morning and <b><u>begin my day with a bit of stretching or jogging</u></b>. Then I wash up and r<b><u>ead something inspiring, usually TED articles</u></b>. After<b><u> a light breakfast—or none at al</u></b>l—I <b><u>head to work</u></b>, which takes me over an hour because of the traffic.- 
	- I normally get up around 6 a.m., and the first thing I do is either read something—like TED talks—or get in a quick workout. I might go for a jog or skip rope, <b><u>just to get energized</u></b>. Then I <b><u>wash up</u></b>, <b><u>grab a quick bite or skip breakfast altogether,</u></b> and <b><u>brace myself for the long commute to work</u></b>, which usually takes over an hour.
    
3. Do you usually follow the same routine every day?
	原：
	- Yes，I follow the same routing on workdays, I usually get up early around 6:30 am and do some exercises like jogging or stretching, then I'll get washed, and grab a quick bite or skip breakfast altogether, and brace myself for long commute to work. But in weekends, It all depends, I may go out for camping with my family or just stay in my room, play video games all day.
	优化：
	- Yes, I usually follow the same routine on weekdays. I wake up around 6:30 a.m., do some light exercises like jogging or stretching, then wash up and either grab a quick breakfast or skip it altogether. After that, I prepare for the long commute to work. However, on weekends, my schedule is more flexible. I might go camping with my family or just stay in and spend the day playing video games.
	- Yeah, <b><u>I pretty much stick to the same routine</u></b> on weekdays. I get up early, <b><u>work out a bit</u></b>, then head to work. But on weekends, it really depends—I might go camping with my family or<b><u> just chill at home</u></b> playing video games.
	- Yes,<b><u> I do follow a set routine during workdays</u></b>. I usually get up at 6:30 a.m., <b><u>exercise for a while</u></b>, get ready, and leave for work after a quick breakfast—or sometimes none at all. The commute takes over an hour. On weekends,<b><u> though, things are more relaxed.</u></b> I might go on a short trip with my family or simply stay home and enjoy some gaming time.
	- For weekdays, <b><u>I follow a fairly strict routine</u></b>. I’m <b><u>up by 6:30,</u></b> do some stretching or jogging, <b><u>get cleaned up,</u></b> have a light breakfast—or skip it—and then <b><u>face a long commute due to heavy traffic</u></b>. But on weekends,<b><u> my schedule is more spontaneous</u></b>. I might go camping with my family if the weather's nice, or just <b><u>unwind at home and spend the day gaming</u></b>.
    
4. Are you a creature of habit?
	- Not really，but I do follow a set of routine during weekdays. I get up early, work out a bit ,then head to work which will take me more than hour. I also do some english practices during lunch break. The routine make me feel exhausted, but I need the work to support my family. I would like my life more flexible if I could.
	- 优化
		- Yes, <b><u>I’d say I am a creature of habit</u></b>, especially on weekdays. I wake up around 6:30, do some morning exercises, then head to work, which takes over an hour due to traffic. I also try to squeeze in some English practice during lunch. Having a routine helps me stay productive and gives structure to my day, even though it can be tiring sometimes.
		- Not really. I do follow a routine on workdays out of necessity, like waking up early, exercising, and commuting. But to be honest, I don't enjoy living by a fixed schedule. I prefer having the freedom to decide what to do based on how I feel. That’s why I love weekends—they give me space to relax and be spontaneous.
		- <b><u>I wouldn't call myself a creature of habit</u></b>, but my job <b><u>kind of forces me into a routine</u></b>. I get up early, do a bit of exercise, and then spend over an hour commuting. I even practice English during lunch breaks to improve myself. <b><u>Honestly, this routine can be exhausting</u></b>, but <b><u>I have to stick with it to support my family</u></b>. If I had more freedom, <b><u>I’d love a more flexible lifestyle</u></b>.
    
5. What’s a habit you have that helps you stay productive?
	- Go to bed early and have a good sleep helps me stay productive mostly, so I usually do some preparation before go do bed, like stretching. And regular exercise in morning would boost my energy but not too often
	- 优化
		- I’d say getting a good night’s sleep is the key for me. I usually go to bed early, and before that, I like to <b><u>stretch a bit to help me wind down</u></b>. I also try to work out in the morning—it’s a great way to <b><u>wake up my body and mind</u></b>, though I don’t do it every single day.
		- <b><u>Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule</u></b> really improves my productivity. I typically go to bed early and do some light stretching beforehand to help me unwind. Morning exercise is another helpful habit—it<b><u> enhances my concentration</u></b> and<b><u> keeps my energy levels stable</u></b> throughout the day.
    
6. Have your habits changed in recent years?
	- I changed me job two years ago so I would take more than an hour on commuting to my company, that cost much of my free time so that now I rarely do physical exercise now, which lead to my over weight
	- 优化
		- Yes, my habits have definitely changed. I changed my job two years ago, and now it takes me over an hour to commute to work. This<b><u> eats up a lot of my free time,</u></b> so I rarely exercise these days, and as a result, I’ve gained some weight.
		- Yeah, they’ve changed quite a bit. I started a new job two years ago, and the long commute—over an hour each way—<b><u>really takes up my free time.</u></b> I used to work out a lot, but now I barely exercise, and I’ve<b><u> put on some weight </u></b>because of that.
		- Absolutely. Since <b><u>switching jobs two</u></b> years ago, my <b><u>daily commute has increased to</u></b> over an hour. This has<b><u> significantly reduced the time I have for physical activity,</u></b> and unfortunately, I’ve become less active and gained some weight as a result.
    
7. Do you prefer having a fixed schedule or a flexible one?
	- A fixed schedule may make me feel boring, but a flexible one may make my plan failed, the key is to maintain a balance between them. The most priority must have a fixed schedule, and flexible should be made due to some emergencies
	- 优化
		- I think both fixed and flexible schedules<b><u> have their pros and cons</u></b>. A fixed schedule helps me stay organized and productive, but it can feel a bit boring at times. On the other hand, a flexible schedule offers freedom, but may <b><u>lead to delays or missed tasks</u></b>. So for me, it’s best to have a fixed plan with some flexibility when needed, like<b><u> in unexpected situations</u></b>.
		- <b><u>I prefer something in between.</u></b> If everything is too fixed, it gets boring and stressful. But if it’s too flexible, I might<b><u> end up getting nothing done</u></b>. So I usually <b><u>stick to a basic routine</u></b>, but I <b><u>leave room to adjust things</u></b> if <b><u>something urgent comes up</u></b>.
		- While a fixed schedule<b><u> helps me stay disciplined </u></b>and ensures tasks are completed on time, I believe <b><u>too much rigidity can limit creativity and cause burnout</u></b>. That’s why I prefer <b><u>a structured routine with built-in flexibility</u></b>. This way, I can <b><u>stay on track</u></b> while <b><u>still adapting to unexpected changes or emergencies</u></b>.
    
8. What time do you usually wake up?
	- I usually wake up before 7 a.m. since I cost more than an hour in commuting  on weekdays, but on weekends, I depends, I may get up early and prepare a good breakfast for my family, or just sleep until I feel it's enough
	- 优化
		- I usually wake up before 7 a.m. on weekdays because <b><u>my commute takes over an hour</u></b>. On weekends, it depends. Sometimes I get up early to make breakfast for my family, but other times I sleep in and <b><u>rest as much as I need.</u></b>
		- During the week, I typically get up before 7 a.m. as my daily commute takes over an hour. However, on weekends, my schedule is more relaxed. I might wake up early to prepare breakfast for my family, or<b><u> simply sleep in to catch up on rest</u></b>.
