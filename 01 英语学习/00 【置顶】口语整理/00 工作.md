	- I think <b><u>I do a decent job of managing my time</u></b>, <b><u>but there’s always room for improvement</u></b>. Some tasks take longer than expected, especially when debugging complex issues. However, I use planning techniques, like <b><u>breaking tasks into smaller parts</u></b> and automating repetitive work, to stay as efficient as possible.
	- Most of the time, yes! But, like any programmer, I occasionally fall into the ‘just five more minutes’ trap when debugging a tricky issue. Jokes aside, I’ve developed solid time management skills over the years, and automation helps me save a lot of time on repetitive tasks.
### Who helps you most at work?
