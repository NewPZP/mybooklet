#### Are the transport facilities in your city very good?
- 思路
- 参考
	- Yes, I think the transport facilities in my city are quite good. Hangzhou<b><u> has an extensive metro system that’s modern, clean, and constantly expanding</u></b>. Public buses are also convenient, and t<b><u>here are shared bikes almost everywhere, which makes getting around the city really easy</u></b>.
	- I’d say the transport in Hangzhou is generally good. The metro system is fast and reliable, and it covers most of the important areas. <b><u>Traffic can be a problem during rush hours, though</u></b>. But overall, it’s quite easy to get around, especially with the shared bike and e-scooter options.
	- Yeah, it’s pretty good! The metro is super convenient and keeps getting better every year. Plus, you can find shared bikes and electric scooters on almost every street, so even short trips are easy. <b><u>The only downside is the traffic—like most big cities, it gets a bit crazy during peak hours</u></b>.
	- <b><u>Overall, yes, but there’s still room for improvement</u></b>. The metro system is great and constantly expanding, but buses can be a bit crowded, and traffic congestion is still a big issue during rush hour. That said, public transport is definitely better than it used to be.
	- Yeah, <b><u>it’s pretty decent</u></b>—at least I don’t have to swim across West Lake to get to work! The metro’s fast and clean, and those shared bikes are everywhere, which is great when you're too impatient to wait for the bus. Just don’t get stuck in traffic at 6 PM—it’s like a parking lot!
	- Public transport like the metro is actually quite good in Hangzhou, but I usually drive to work. Unfortunately, traffic is a big issue here—it often takes me over an hour to get to the office, especially during rush hour. Even at night, the roads are still crowded. So while the infrastructure is there, <b><u>the traffic volume</u></b> is a real challenge.
###  Which room does your family spend most of the time in?
- 思路

	- In my family, we probably spend the most time in the dining room. It’s not just where we eat meals—it’s kind of the center of daily life. After dinner, we often sit around the table chatting, drinking tea, or just checking our phones and relaxing. It’s a space that feels warm and familiar, and it naturally brings everyone together, especially in the evenings.
	- I’d say the living room is the space where we gather the most. It’s where we unwind after a long day, watch TV shows or movies, and sometimes even have casual conversations late at night. The sofa is super comfy, and the atmosphere is relaxed, so it naturally becomes the spot where we all drift to, especially on weekends or holidays.
	- Surprisingly, the kitchen is one of the busiest rooms in our house. While someone’s cooking, others tend to hang around, either helping out or just chatting. It’s not very big, but somehow it always feels full of energy. We even have a small table there where we sometimes have quick breakfasts or late-night snacks. It feels alive, like the heart of the home.
	- To be honest, since everyone in my family has a pretty busy schedule, we each spend quite a bit of time in our own rooms. It’s our personal space to work, study, or just unwind. For example, I sometimes bring my laptop to my room to handle some tasks after dinner. So although we do come together during meals or on weekends, the bedroom is where we each get some peace and quiet.
	- <b><u>It really depends on the time of day or the day of the week</u></b>. On weekdays, everyone’s busy with their own work or studies, so we mostly stay in our rooms. But on weekends or holidays, <b><u>we naturally gather in the living room</u></b> or dining room, sharing food, watching something together, or just chatting. The way we use space at home is quite flexible, depending on our mood and routines.
### Do you live in a house or a flat
- 思路
- 参考
	- I live in a flat, <b><u>which is pretty common in big cities like Hangzhou</u></b>. It’s located in a residential complex with good security and convenient facilities like a supermarket and gym downstairs. The apartment itself isn’t huge, but it’s cozy and well-organized. I like it because it’s close to work, which saves me a lot of commuting time—well, at least compared to living in the suburbs.
	- I live in a flat with my family. It’s a three-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building. It’s not luxurious or anything, but it’s very practical and comfortable. One thing I like about it is the view—we’re high up, so we can see the city skyline, especially at night when all the lights come on. It feels peaceful and modern at the same time.
	- <b><u>I live in a flat, like most people in my city</u></b>. <b><u>Housing prices are really high here, so having a private house is not very realistic unless you’re super rich.</u></b> But I’m quite satisfied with my apartment—<b><u>it’s compact</u></b>, <b><u>easy to maintain</u></b>, and <b><u>well-connected to public transport.</u></b> <b><u>Everything I need is just a short walk or drive away</u></b>.
	- I live in a flat with my parents. It’s a typical apartment in a quiet neighborhood. The flat isn’t big, but we’ve lived there for years, so it feels like home. We’ve decorated it over time to suit our lifestyle, and even though space is limited, it’s warm and full of memories. I think what matters most is who you live with, not the size of the place.
	- I live in a flat, like most working people in cities these days. It’s comfortable and practical, though I wouldn’t mind a bit more space—especially when I’m trying to find a quiet corner to work or relax. Still, it’s got everything I need, and the neighbors are nice, which really makes a difference.
### Do you plan to live here for a long time
- 思路
- 参考
	- <b><u>To be honest, I’m not entirely sure</u></b>. Right now, living here <b><u>makes sense</u></b> because <b><u>my job is based in this city</u></b>, and everything I need <b><u>is close by</u></b>. <b><u>But in the long run</u></b>, if I get a better opportunity elsewhere or decide to pursue a different lifestyle, I might consider moving. So<b><u> I wouldn’t say it’s a forever plan</u></b>, but <b><u>for now, it works well for me</u></b>.
	- <b><u>At the moment,</u></b> I don’t have any plans to move. <b><u>I’ve built a stable life here</u></b>—my job, friends, and routines <b><u>are all based in this city.</u></b> <b><u>But of course, life can be unpredictable</u></b>. If I ever decide to <b><u>switch careers</u></b> or <b><u>explore something new</u></b>, <b><u>I might consider relocating</u></b>. For now, though, <b><u>I’m quite settled</u></b>.
	- I’ve lived here for quite a long time, and <b><u>I’m used to the pace and lifestyle</u></b>. But to be honest, <b><u>sometimes I do think about moving to a quieter place</u></b>, maybe somewhere less crowded or stressful. So <b><u>I wouldn’t say I’ll stay here forever,</u></b> but I also <b><u>don’t have any concrete plans</u></b> to leave <b><u>in the near future</u></b>.
	- I don’t really<b><u> have a long-term plan set in stone</u></b>. For now, I’m focused on my work and daily life, and this city provides everything I need. But if things change—like if I start a family or want a different kind of environment—I might move. So<b><u> I’m keeping my options open</u></b>.
