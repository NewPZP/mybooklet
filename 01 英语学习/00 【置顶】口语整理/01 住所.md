#### Are the transport facilities in your city very good?

	- Yes, I think the transport facilities in my city are quite good. Hangzhou<b><u> has an extensive metro system that’s modern, clean, and constantly expanding</u></b>. Public buses are also convenient, and t<b><u>here are shared bikes almost everywhere, which makes getting around the city really easy</u></b>.
	- I’d say the transport in Hangzhou is generally good. The metro system is fast and reliable, and it covers most of the important areas. <b><u>Traffic can be a problem during rush hours, though</u></b>. But overall, it’s quite easy to get around, especially with the shared bike and e-scooter options.
	- Yeah, it’s pretty good! The metro is super convenient and keeps getting better every year. Plus, you can find shared bikes and electric scooters on almost every street, so even short trips are easy. <b><u>The only downside is the traffic—like most big cities, it gets a bit crazy during peak hours</u></b>.
	- <b><u>Overall, yes, but there’s still room for improvement</u></b>. The metro system is great and constantly expanding, but buses can be a bit crowded, and traffic congestion is still a big issue during rush hour. That said, public transport is definitely better than it used to be.
	- Yeah, it’s pretty decent—at least I don’t have to swim across West Lake to get to work! The metro’s fast and clean, and those shared bikes are everywhere, which is great when you're too impatient to wait for the bus. Just don’t get stuck in traffic at 6 PM—it’s like a parking lot!
	- Public transport like the metro is actually quite good in Hangzhou, but I usually drive to work. Unfortunately, traffic is a big issue here—it often takes me over an hour to get to the office, especially during rush hour. Even at night, the roads are still crowded. So while the infrastructure is there, the traffic volume is a real challenge.
###  Which room does your family spend most of the time in?

	- In my family, we probably spend the most time in the dining room. It’s not just where we eat meals—it’s kind of the center of daily life. After dinner, we often sit around the table chatting, drinking tea, or just checking our phones and relaxing. It’s a space that feels warm and familiar, and it naturally brings everyone together, especially in the evenings.
