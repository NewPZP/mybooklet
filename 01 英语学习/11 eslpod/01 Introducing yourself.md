The seat should be level front to back. the seat height should be adjusted to allow a slight bend at the knee when the leg is fully extended. the handlebar height should be at the same level with the seat

Also wear something that reflects lights, such as reflective tape or markings, or flashing lights. remember, just because you can see a driver doesn't mean the driver can see you.


## 我的自我介绍
I was born in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China, and grew up in a modest family. Despite our limited financial resources, my parents worked tirelessly to ensure that both my older sister and I could pursue higher education. I spent my early years in a small rural village in Wenzhou until I gained admission to a prestigious university in Xi'an. There, I majored in Software Engineering and successfully obtained my bachelor's degree after four years of dedicated study.
Following graduation, I embarked on professional journeys in both Nanjing and Ningbo before eventually settling in Hangzhou. Known for its breathtaking beauty, Hangzhou captured my heart, and I decided to make it my permanent home. I have been working as a software engineer here for over seven years now, honing my skills and contributing to the vibrant tech industry of this city.
