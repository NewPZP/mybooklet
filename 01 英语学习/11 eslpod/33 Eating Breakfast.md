## Note
- **When I have time**, I like to cook a hot breakfast, so I take out of the frying pan, pour a little oil in it, and turn on the front burner on the stovetop. While the eggs are cooking, I put two pieces of bread into the toaster. When the eggs are nice and brown on the edges, I use a spatula to put them on the plate. **Some mornings**, I have to **settle for** some cold cereal or just toast with jam, but it's nice to start they day with a sit-down meal when I get the chance.
