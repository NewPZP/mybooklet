## Note
- A little time can go a long way in improving or maintaining good heath.
- Even small steps can mean big rewards in preventing illness and injury.
- When I get home, I change into my casual clothes and head for the kitchen.
- Then I shape the dough into circles, put them on the cookie sheet, and put the pan into the oven.
- That should make the day go by a little faster.
