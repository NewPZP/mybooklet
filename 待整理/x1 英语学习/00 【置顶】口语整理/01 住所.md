#### Are the transport facilities in your city very good?
- 思路
- 参考
	- Yes, I think the transport facilities in my city are quite good. Hangzhou<b><u> has an extensive metro system that’s modern, clean, and constantly expanding</u></b>. Public buses are also convenient, and t<b><u>here are shared bikes almost everywhere, which makes getting around the city really easy</u></b>.
	- I’d say the transport in Hangzhou is generally good. The metro system is fast and reliable, and it covers most of the important areas. <b><u>Traffic can be a problem during rush hours, though</u></b>. But overall, it’s quite easy to get around, especially with the shared bike and e-scooter options.
	- Yeah, it’s pretty good! The metro is super convenient and keeps getting better every year. Plus, you can find shared bikes and electric scooters on almost every street, so even short trips are easy. <b><u>The only downside is the traffic—like most big cities, it gets a bit crazy during peak hours</u></b>.
	- <b><u>Overall, yes, but there’s still room for improvement</u></b>. The metro system is great and constantly expanding, but buses can be a bit crowded, and traffic congestion is still a big issue during rush hour. That said, public transport is definitely better than it used to be.
	- Yeah, <b><u>it’s pretty decent</u></b>—at least I don’t have to swim across West Lake to get to work! The metro’s fast and clean, and those shared bikes are everywhere, which is great when you're too impatient to wait for the bus. Just don’t get stuck in traffic at 6 PM—it’s like a parking lot!
	- Public transport like the metro is actually quite good in Hangzhou, but I usually drive to work. Unfortunately, traffic is a big issue here—it often takes me over an hour to get to the office, especially during rush hour. Even at night, the roads are still crowded. So while the infrastructure is there, <b><u>the traffic volume</u></b> is a real challenge.
###  Which room does your family spend most of the time in?
- 思路
- 参考
	- In my family, we probably spend the most time in the dining room. It’s not just where we eat meals—it’s kind of the center of daily life. After dinner, we often sit around the table chatting, drinking tea, or just checking our phones and relaxing. It’s a space that feels warm and familiar, and it naturally brings everyone together, especially in the evenings.
	- I’d say the living room is the space where we gather the most. It’s where we unwind after a long day, watch TV shows or movies, and sometimes even have casual conversations late at night. The sofa is super comfy, and the atmosphere is relaxed, so it naturally becomes the spot where we all drift to, especially on weekends or holidays.
	- Surprisingly, the kitchen is one of the busiest rooms in our house. While someone’s cooking, others tend to hang around, either helping out or just chatting. It’s not very big, but somehow it always feels full of energy. We even have a small table there where we sometimes have quick breakfasts or late-night snacks. It feels alive, like the heart of the home.
	- To be honest, since everyone in my family has a pretty busy schedule, we each spend quite a bit of time in our own rooms. It’s our personal space to work, study, or just unwind. For example, I sometimes bring my laptop to my room to handle some tasks after dinner. So although we do come together during meals or on weekends, the bedroom is where we each get some peace and quiet.
	- <b><u>It really depends on the time of day or the day of the week</u></b>. On weekdays, everyone’s busy with their own work or studies, so we mostly stay in our rooms. But on weekends or holidays, <b><u>we naturally gather in the living room</u></b> or dining room, sharing food, watching something together, or just chatting. The way we use space at home is quite flexible, depending on our mood and routines.
### Do you live in a house or a flat
- 思路
- 参考
	- I live in a flat, <b><u>which is pretty common in big cities like Hangzhou</u></b>. It’s located in a residential complex with good security and convenient facilities like a supermarket and gym downstairs. The apartment itself isn’t huge, but it’s cozy and well-organized. I like it because it’s close to work, which saves me a lot of commuting time—well, at least compared to living in the suburbs.
	- I live in a flat with my family. It’s a three-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building. It’s not luxurious or anything, but it’s very practical and comfortable. One thing I like about it is the view—we’re high up, so we can see the city skyline, especially at night when all the lights come on. It feels peaceful and modern at the same time.
	- <b><u>I live in a flat, like most people in my city</u></b>. <b><u>Housing prices are really high here, so having a private house is not very realistic unless you’re super rich.</u></b> But I’m quite satisfied with my apartment—<b><u>it’s compact</u></b>, <b><u>easy to maintain</u></b>, and <b><u>well-connected to public transport.</u></b> <b><u>Everything I need is just a short walk or drive away</u></b>.
	- I live in a flat with my parents. It’s a typical apartment in a quiet neighborhood. The flat isn’t big, but we’ve lived there for years, so it feels like home. We’ve decorated it over time to suit our lifestyle, and even though space is limited, it’s warm and full of memories. I think what matters most is who you live with, not the size of the place.
	- I live in a flat, like most working people in cities these days. It’s comfortable and practical, though I wouldn’t mind a bit more space—especially when I’m trying to find a quiet corner to work or relax. Still, it’s got everything I need, and the neighbors are nice, which really makes a difference.
### Do you plan to live here for a long time
- 思路
- 参考
	- <b><u>To be honest, I’m not entirely sure</u></b>. Right now, living here <b><u>makes sense</u></b> because <b><u>my job is based in this city</u></b>, and everything I need <b><u>is close by</u></b>. <b><u>But in the long run</u></b>, if I get a better opportunity elsewhere or decide to pursue a different lifestyle, I might consider moving. So<b><u> I wouldn’t say it’s a forever plan</u></b>, but <b><u>for now, it works well for me</u></b>.
	- <b><u>At the moment,</u></b> I don’t have any plans to move. <b><u>I’ve built a stable life here</u></b>—my job, friends, and routines <b><u>are all based in this city.</u></b> <b><u>But of course, life can be unpredictable</u></b>. If I ever decide to <b><u>switch careers</u></b> or <b><u>explore something new</u></b>, <b><u>I might consider relocating</u></b>. For now, though, <b><u>I’m quite settled</u></b>.
	- I’ve lived here for quite a long time, and <b><u>I’m used to the pace and lifestyle</u></b>. But to be honest, <b><u>sometimes I do think about moving to a quieter place</u></b>, maybe somewhere less crowded or stressful. So <b><u>I wouldn’t say I’ll stay here forever,</u></b> but I also <b><u>don’t have any concrete plans</u></b> to leave <b><u>in the near future</u></b>.
	- I don’t really<b><u> have a long-term plan set in stone</u></b>. For now, I’m focused on my work and daily life, and this city provides everything I need. But if things change—like if I start a family or want a different kind of environment—I might move. So<b><u> I’m keeping my options open</u></b>.
### Do you live alone or with your family?
- 思路

	- I live with my wife, and we just had a baby recently, so life has been quite busy—but also very joyful. These days, my parents often come over to help us take care of the baby. It’s really nice to have their support, especially when we’re still adjusting to being new parents. So I’d say it’s a family effort right now!
	- At the moment, I live with my wife, and <b><u>we recently welcomed a baby into the family.</u></b> It’s been an exciting but also challenging time. Since both of us are working, my parents sometimes stay with us <b><u>to help out with childcare and household chores</u></b>. <b><u>It makes a big difference</u></b>, and I really appreciate their help.
	- I’m currently living with my wife, and we just had our first child not long ago. Since we’re both quite busy with work, my parents come over regularly to lend a hand, especially with the baby. It’s definitely more crowded than before, but also much warmer—it feels more like a real family home now.
	- I live with my wife, and recently we’ve had a big change—we became new parents! So now my parents often come to stay with us to help with the baby. Honestly, it’s a full house these days, but I’m really grateful. Without them, we’d probably be running on zero sleep!
	- Right now, I live with my wife, and we just had a baby not long ago. Because of that, my parents have been spending a lot of time at our place to help us look after the little one. It’s been a big adjustment for all of us, but I feel lucky to have a strong support system around me.

### What do you usually do in your flat？
- 思路

	- At home, I mainly use the time to relax and recharge after work. I usually watch TV shows, play some video games, or just read a book. Sometimes I’ll cook simple meals with my wife or just spend time playing with our baby. It’s a good balance between winding down and family time.
	- I’m definitely more of a homebody, so when I’m in my flat, I usually keep it simple—watching movies, listening to music, or just scrolling through my phone. Lately, most of my free time is spent with my family, especially helping with the baby. It’s not super exciting, but it’s comforting.
	- These days, I spend a lot of time looking after my baby when I’m at home. Apart from that, I sometimes do a bit of work on my laptop, especially if there are urgent tasks from my job. Of course, I also try to relax by watching some shows or chatting with my wife. Home is a place where I can slow down and enjoy the small moments.
	- Usually, I try to keep a balance between being productive and relaxing. I sometimes work on personal projects, like improving my coding skills or learning new tech tools. Other times, I just kick back, watch some variety shows, or spend time playing with my little one. It really depends on my mood.
	- To be honest, most of my time at home is split between working, parenting, and trying to catch some sleep! With a baby in the house, there’s never a dull moment. When I do get a break, I just enjoy doing simple things like having a cup of coffee, watching a show, or playing a quick mobile game.
### Which is your favorite room in your home?
- 思路
- 参考
	- My favorite room is definitely the living room. It’s where my family and I spend most of our time together—watching TV, playing with our baby, or just chatting after a busy day. It’s a cozy space that really feels like the heart of our home.
	- I would say the bedroom is my favorite room. After a long day at work, there’s nothing better than coming back to a quiet and comfortable space. It’s where I can really relax, read a bit, and recharge for the next day.
	- Right now, I really like the small study area in our flat. It’s where I can focus on work, learn new skills, or just have some quiet time. It’s not a big space, but it <b><u>gives me a sense of personal freedom,</u></b> <b><u>which is very precious when you have a baby at home</u></b>.
	- These days, my favorite room is actually the baby’s room. Watching my little one grow and play there brings me a lot of joy. We decorated it with soft colors and cute toys, and every time I step into that room, it reminds me how much our lives have changed—in a good way.
	- Honestly, my favorite room keeps changing! Before we had a baby, it was definitely the living room. Now, sometimes I feel like the bathroom is my favorite, just because it’s one of the few quiet places left in the house! But jokes aside, I think the living room still wins, because it’s where we laugh and relax as a family.
### What 's the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past?
- 参考
	- Before moving to Hangzhou, I lived in a small village where life was much slower and quieter. Now, living in a big city, everything feels much faster and more competitive. The transportation is more convenient, the job opportunities are better, but sometimes I do miss the fresh air and peaceful atmosphere of my hometown.
	- In the past, I lived in a much smaller flat when I first started working. I<b><u>t was quite basic—just enough space for myself</u></b>. Now, I live in a bigger apartment with my wife and baby, and <b><u>the environment feels much more like a real home</u></b>. We have more space, better furniture, and <b><u>it's generally a lot more comfortable</u></b>.
	- <b><u>Where I lived before, I was single and renting a small room</u></b>, so life was pretty simple and flexible. Now, living with my own family, the lifestyle is totally different. There’s much more responsibility—I need to take care of my wife, my baby, and manage the household. But at the same time, it feels much more meaningful.
	- In the past, I lived in a more remote area where everything—shopping, dining, commuting—took a lot of time and effort. Now, living in Hangzhou, I have everything I need just around the corner. It’s much more convenient, though sometimes the noise and traffic can be a bit overwhelming.
	- I think the biggest difference isn’t just the place, but how much I’ve grown personally. When I lived in my hometown, I was just starting out in life. Now, after moving to Hangzhou, I’ve built a career, started a family, and taken on more responsibilities. So the change is not just physical, it’s emotional as well.
###  What can you see when you look out the window of your room?
- 思路
- 参考
	- When I look out of my window, I can see a row of high-rise buildings and busy streets filled with cars. In the evening, the city lights come on and the whole view looks quite beautiful. It’s a bit noisy sometimes, but I actually enjoy seeing the city alive and full of energy.
	- From my window, I can see a little park across the street, with lots of green trees and people walking their dogs. Behind that, there are some tall office buildings. It’s a nice mix of nature and city life, which makes the view quite relaxing.
	- When I look outside, most of what I see is traffic. There’s a main road nearby, so there are always cars, buses, and even delivery riders rushing past. It’s pretty noisy during rush hour, but after living here for a few years, I’ve gotten used to it—it’s part of the rhythm of city life.
	- Looking out of my window, I usually see a lot of grey buildings and busy roads. But honestly, what catches my eye most is the weather. On sunny days, the buildings shine under the blue sky, and everything feels vibrant. On rainy days, the view gets a bit gloomy, but somehow, it feels quite peaceful too.
	- From my room, I can see the neighboring apartment blocks, and sometimes I even spot other people standing by their windows, probably doing the same thing—staring outside! It's not the most amazing view in the world, but it’s fun to imagine what stories are happening behind those windows.
### Would you be willing to live in the countryside in the future?
- 参考
	- Yes, I would love to live in the countryside in the future. After years of living in a busy city like Hangzhou, I<b><u> sometimes feel overwhelmed by</u></b> the noise and traffic. Moving to the countryside <b><u>would give me a chance to</u></b> enjoy a quieter life, breathe fresh air, and be closer to nature. I think it would be the perfect environment for raising a child as well.
	- I think I <b><u>would be willing to </u></b>live in the countryside,<b><u> but</u></b> probably not right now. At this stage of <b><u>my life, my work and family are based in the city</u></b>, and I need to stay close to good schools and hospitals. But maybe after I retire, I would love to move somewhere peaceful and slow-paced.
	- To be honest, I don't think I would want to live in the countryside permanently. I enjoy the convenience of city life too much—things like public transport, shopping centers, and entertainment options. I might visit the countryside for vacations, but<b><u> living there full-time might feel too isolated for me</u></b>.
	- <b><u>It really depends</u></b>. If I could work remotely and still have access to good facilities, I think living in the countryside could be wonderful. <b><u>The idea of having a big garden, growing my own vegetables, and enjoying a slower lifestyle sounds appealing</u></b>. But if it means giving up too many conveniences, I might hesitate.
	- Actually, it’s a bit of a dream of mine to live in the countryside someday. I imagine having a small house surrounded by trees, a quiet place where my family can enjoy outdoor activities together. It would be a huge change from city life, but sometimes, change is exactly what we need to find happiness.
### Are you a person who likes to stay at home?
- 样例
	- Yes,<b><u> I would consider myself a home-oriented person</u></b>. After a long and often stressful day at work, I genuinely enjoy the comfort and familiarity of my own space. Staying at home <b><u>gives me a sense of peace and stability,</u></b> especially now that I have a young child. I find great joy in simple routines—like having dinner with my wife, playing with my baby, or just winding down with a good show. While I do go out occasionally, I rarely feel the need to be constantly out and about. For me, <b><u>home is where I truly recharge</u></b>.
	- Yes, I do enjoy staying at home, especially after a long day at work. It helps me unwind and spend quality time with my family. I think having a calm and familiar environment at home gives me better work-life balance. I’m not someone who needs to go out all the time to feel happy.
	- Absolutely. Home is where I feel the most at ease. Now that I have a baby, staying at home has become even more meaningful—there’s nothing better than watching my little one laugh or sleep peacefully. It’s my safe space where I can truly relax and enjoy the simple things.
	- To be honest, I’m a bit of a homebody. I mean, why go out when you have a comfy sofa, good food, and fast Wi-Fi? I enjoy going out sometimes, but honestly, staying in just feels easier and more relaxing most of the time.
	- <b><u>I wouldn’t say I’m a total homebody</u></b>, but <b><u>I do appreciate the calm and privacy that staying at home offers</u></b>. If I had a busy or stressful day, spending time at home really helps me recharge. <b><u>It’s like my personal retreat from the outside world.</u></b>
	- I enjoy being at home, but I also like going out from time to time. On weekdays, I prefer staying in and relaxing with my family, but on weekends I might go out for a walk or meet up with friends. So I guess I like a good balance between both.
