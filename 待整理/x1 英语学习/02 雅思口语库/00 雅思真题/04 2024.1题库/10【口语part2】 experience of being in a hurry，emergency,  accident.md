#### A:
<b><u>In the hustle and bustle of daily life</u></b>, I vividly recall on occasion when I found myself having to  rush to the airport for an unexpected business trip. The urgency arose from an impromptu meeting scheduled with a client overseas. I had to pack essentials, gather crucial documents, and <b><u>arrange transportation within a remarkably short timeframe</u></b>.

<b><u>The need to act swiftly was propelled by the importance of the meeting,</u></b> where a potential business deal hinged on my prompt presence. Despite the time constraints, I managed to organize my belongings efficiently and secure the necessary paperwork. T<b><u>he challenge lay in coordinating transportation on short notice</u></b>, but with the help of <b><u>ride-hailing services</u></b>, I reached the airport just in time to catch my flight.

While the experience was undoubtedly stressful,<b><u> the successful execution of my tasks within the hurried timeframe left me with a sense of accomplishment.</u></b> It highlighted my ability to <b><u>remain composed</u></b> under pressure and make quick, effective decisions. However, the<b><u> overall feeling was a mix of relief and adrenaline</u></b>, as I pondered the necessity of adapting to unexpected situations in the professional realm. I hope I can<b><u> further nurture and maintain this life skill</u></b>! I think that life is often full of these kinds of pressures and challenges and everyone should <b><u>develop their own capacity to deal with hurried and highly tense and stressful situations</u></b>

#### Q: Describe a time when you were very busy.
You should say
- When it happened
- Where you were
- What you did
- And explain why you are very busy
#### A: 
There have been many times when I've been really busy, but<b><u> a time that immediately comes to mind is </u></b>when I was preparing for an exhibition with a friend in university. <b><u>I'll try to explain what went on</u></b>. <b><u>Basically</u></b>, I was in charge of an art exhibition of paintings from a South American painter for the university Spanish department. You see, I was one of the main student, let's say, in the third year, and so I got involved in all sorts of exchange programmes and things like that. Anyway, there  was this South American art exhibition which was to be hosted for two weeks in one of the gallery spaces in the next campus. I was in charge of making sure all the paintings were unpacked and put up in the gallery after the shipment arrived at the department, and advertising the exhibition, and organizing the opening event. You see, there's always an opening event at art exhibitions, where you provide wine and snacks and there's a little talk and an introduction to the artist and some of their paintings, <b><u>and all of that.</u></b> You see, the artist herself could not attend, so I was kind of representing her.

The reason I was really busy was because<b><u> I had to juggle different things all at the same time,</u></b> or at least it seemed like it. I had to not only ensure that all the paintings were unpacked very carefully, then put up on the exhibition walls in the exact way that the artist had explained (she provided a diagram and explanation of how to lay them out), then stick labels under each painting, that corresponded to make fliers, and advertisements for the event, make an invitation list.... Then organize the <b><u>catering</u></b> , the snacks and wine.... You can imagine! All of that to host gallery exhibition opening. And I was determined to do a good job, because, on top of all that I had to manage a photographer and videographer to take photos and film the event, to put on the artist's website.

So, basically for several weeks before the exhibition, <b><u>and especially in the days preceding the exhibition</u></b>, <b><u>I was incredibly busy, and quite stressed out,</u></b> and trying to keep everything and everybody who was involved in the project, <b><u>in order and properly organized </u></b>so the event was a success
