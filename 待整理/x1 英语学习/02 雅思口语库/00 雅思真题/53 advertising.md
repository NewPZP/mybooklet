# IELTS Speaking Practice: Advertisement-related Questions

## 1. Do you like advertisements on TV or some other products?

1. As a programmer who spends most of my day immersed in code, I find TV advertisements to be a refreshing break from the digital world. They often serve as a window into current trends and societal shifts, which can be quite enlightening. However, I must admit that I'm more drawn to product advertisements that showcase innovative technology or gadgets, as they align more closely with my professional interests and often spark ideas for potential side projects.

2. To be honest, my relationship with advertisements is rather ambivalent. Growing up in a small village near Wenzhou, we had limited exposure to commercials, which made them seem almost magical when we did see them. Now, working in a bustling city and constantly surrounded by ads, I find myself appreciating those that are clever or thought-provoking, especially ones that remind me of my rural roots or incorporate elements of Wenzhou dialect, as they provide a nostalgic connection to my hometown.

3. Given my background in technology and my aspiration to become a freelancer, I tend to pay more attention to advertisements related to productivity tools or online platforms. These ads often introduce me to new software or services that could potentially enhance my work efficiency or help me in my future entrepreneurial endeavors. That said, I do enjoy the occasional quirky or humorous ad during my downtime, particularly when I'm unwinding after a long day of coding.

4. As someone who enjoys sports like badminton and table tennis, I find myself drawn to advertisements featuring athletes or sports equipment. These commercials often resonate with my personal interests and sometimes even motivate me to maintain my exercise routines, like jogging and skipping rope. However, I'm less enthusiastic about ads that interrupt my viewing experience, especially when I'm watching tutorials or educational content related to programming.

5. Coming from a programming background, I tend to analyze advertisements from a technical perspective. I'm fascinated by the use of special effects, computer-generated imagery, and data-driven marketing strategies in modern ads. While I may not always be the target audience, I appreciate the creativity and technological prowess that goes into creating compelling advertisements, especially those that manage to tell a story or evoke emotions in a short span of time.

## 2. Were there any advertisements that impressed you when you were young?

1. Growing up in a small village near Wenzhou, one advertisement that left a lasting impression on me was for a popular brand of sports shoes. The commercial featured a young athlete from a rural background, much like myself, who overcame obstacles to achieve success. This resonated deeply with me and fueled my ambition to pursue a career in technology, despite coming from a humble background. Even now, as a programmer, I often reflect on that ad when facing challenges in my work.

2. During my childhood, there was a memorable advertisement for a local Wenzhou delicacy that used our regional dialect. As a young boy, hearing our local language on television was incredibly exciting and made me feel a sense of pride in our culture. This experience has stayed with me, and now, as a programmer working in a big city, I often find myself appreciating ads that celebrate diversity and local cultures, recognizing the impact they can have on young minds.

3. One of the most impressive advertisements I recall from my youth was for a computer brand. At that time, living in a rural area, computers were a rarity, and this ad opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. The commercial showcased how technology could bridge gaps and connect people, which ultimately inspired my career choice. Now, as I work towards becoming a freelance programmer, I often think back to that ad and marvel at how far technology has come.

4. An advertisement that struck a chord with me in my younger years was for a traditional Chinese medicine brand. The commercial beautifully blended modern storytelling with ancient wisdom, showcasing the balance between progress and tradition. This concept of harmonizing the old and the new has significantly influenced my approach to programming, where I strive to write efficient, cutting-edge code while respecting established principles and methodologies.

5. When I was young, an advertisement for a popular instant noodle brand left a strong impression on me. The commercial depicted people from all walks of life enjoying the product, including students burning the midnight oil. Little did I know then that I would one day be a programmer, often relying on quick meals during late-night coding sessions. This ad not only made me appreciate the product but also subtly prepared me for the realities of a demanding career in technology.

## 3. Will you do work related to advertising?

1. As a programmer with aspirations of becoming a freelancer, I'm actually quite open to working in the advertising industry. The intersection of technology and advertising, particularly in the realm of digital marketing and ad tech, presents exciting opportunities to apply my coding skills in innovative ways. I could see myself developing algorithms for targeted advertising or creating interactive ad experiences, combining my technical expertise with the creative aspects of advertising.

2. While my current focus is on software development, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of venturing into advertising-related work in the future. Given my background in programming and my experience growing up in Wenzhou, I could potentially contribute to creating culturally nuanced digital advertising campaigns. This could be an interesting way to blend my technical skills with my cultural insights, especially as companies increasingly seek to personalize their messaging for diverse audiences.

3. To be honest, I've never seriously considered a career in advertising before. My passion lies in coding and problem-solving, and I'm not sure how well that aligns with the creative demands of the advertising world. However, as I work towards becoming a freelancer, I recognize the importance of marketing my own services effectively. So while I may not work directly in advertising, I'll certainly be honing my skills in self-promotion and personal branding.

4. The idea of working in advertising is intriguing, especially given the industry's increasing reliance on data analytics and artificial intelligence. As a programmer, I could potentially contribute to developing sophisticated ad targeting systems or creating data visualization tools for campaign analysis. That said, my true passion lies in creating useful software applications, so any foray into advertising would likely be from a technical perspective rather than a creative one.

5. Given my background in programming and my hobbies like badminton and table tennis, I could see myself potentially working on advertising projects related to sports technology. For instance, developing apps that incorporate augmented reality for interactive sports equipment ads or creating data-driven campaigns for fitness products. This would allow me to combine my technical skills with my personal interests, while also tapping into the dynamic world of advertising.

## 4. What kind of advertisements are shown in public places?

1. In the bustling city where I now work as a programmer, public advertisements are a vibrant part of the urban landscape. Large LED screens on skyscrapers often display dynamic ads for tech products and services, which I find particularly engaging given my professional background. It's fascinating to see how these ads use cutting-edge display technologies to capture attention, sometimes making me ponder about the complex systems and code running behind these impressive visual displays.

2. Coming from a small village near Wenzhou to a big city, I've noticed a stark contrast in public advertising. In urban areas, you'll find a mix of traditional billboards and modern digital displays showcasing everything from luxury goods to local services. What's interesting is how these ads often reflect the fast-paced, technology-driven lifestyle of city dwellers - a world apart from the simpler, more community-focused advertisements I remember from my hometown.

3. As someone who enjoys sports like badminton and jogging, I've noticed that public spaces often feature health and fitness-related advertisements. You'll see billboards promoting sports equipment, health supplements, and fitness apps on bus stops and along jogging trails. It's intriguing how these ads are strategically placed to catch the attention of health-conscious individuals, often motivating me to maintain my exercise routines even on busy days filled with coding.

4. In my experience, public transportation hubs like subway stations and bus terminals are hotspots for diverse advertising. You'll find everything from posters promoting local events and cultural exhibitions to interactive digital ads for mobile apps and online services. As a programmer, I'm particularly impressed by the QR code-based advertisements that bridge the physical and digital worlds, allowing commuters to instantly access more information or download apps.

5. One type of public advertisement that has caught my attention, especially given my aspiration to become a freelancer, are those promoting online learning platforms and professional development courses. These ads, often seen on university campuses and in business districts, showcase the growing trend of continuous learning and upskilling. They serve as constant reminders of the importance of staying updated in the fast-evolving tech industry, sometimes prompting me to consider expanding my skill set beyond just programming.
