# IELTS Speaking Practice: Singing-related Questions

## 1. Do you like singing?

1. As a programmer immersed in logic and code all day, I find singing to be a refreshing change of pace that allows me to exercise a different part of my brain. While I'm far from a professional, I enjoy belting out traditional Wenzhou folk songs in the shower or humming popular tunes while jogging. It's a way for me to connect with my cultural roots and unwind after a long day of staring at screens.

2. To be honest, my relationship with singing is quite complex. Growing up in a small village in Wenzhou, group singing was a common pastime, and I have fond memories of joining in during festivals and gatherings. However, as I've transitioned into the tech world, I've found less time for such activities. These days, I mainly sing to myself while coding or during my daily skipping rope routine, finding it a great way to maintain focus and rhythm.

3. While I wouldn't say I'm particularly fond of singing in public, I do enjoy it in more private settings. As someone who spends most of their day engaged in logical thinking, singing provides a much-needed emotional outlet. I often find myself humming melodies in Wenzhou dialect while working on complex programming problems, as it helps me think more creatively and stay connected to my roots.

4. Surprisingly, given my usually reserved nature as a programmer, I have a secret passion for karaoke. There's something liberating about belting out popular songs after a stressful week of coding. I particularly enjoy singing duets with colleagues during company events, as it's a great way to bond and showcase a different side of myself outside of work.

5. As someone who enjoys the adrenaline rush of roller coasters, I find that singing gives me a similar thrill, albeit in a more controlled environment. Whether it's hitting a high note or mastering a difficult melody, there's a sense of accomplishment that rivals solving a complex coding problem. However, I tend to limit my performances to the car during my commute or while playing badminton with friends, where the physical exertion helps mask any vocal shortcomings.

## 2. Do you have any singing classes at school?

1. During my school days in the small village near Wenzhou, formal singing classes were not part of our regular curriculum. However, we did have music appreciation sessions where we learned about traditional Chinese opera and folk songs. These classes sparked my interest in our rich musical heritage, which I now explore through online tutorials during breaks from my programming work.

2. While we didn't have dedicated singing classes, our school organized an annual talent show where students could showcase their vocal abilities. I remember participating one year, nervously singing a popular Wenzhou dialect song. Although I didn't win, the experience boosted my confidence and taught me valuable lessons about performing under pressure - skills that have surprisingly come in handy during important presentations in my current tech job.

3. In my school, singing was integrated into our broader music education rather than being taught as a separate subject. We learned the basics of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, often through group singing activities. Interestingly, these early lessons in harmonizing with others have proven useful in my career as a programmer, where collaboration and 'being in sync' with team members is crucial.

4. Looking back, I wish we had more formal singing classes in school. Our music education was quite limited, focusing mainly on theory and appreciation rather than practical skills. However, this lack of formal training didn't dampen my enthusiasm for singing; if anything, it motivated me to explore it as a hobby later in life, providing a creative counterbalance to my logical, code-driven workdays.

5. While we didn't have regular singing classes, our school did bring in professional singers once a year for a special workshop. These sessions were eye-opening, introducing us to various vocal techniques and styles. Although I pursued a career in technology, the lessons about breath control and projection have been surprisingly applicable, helping me deliver more engaging presentations and communicate more effectively in my role as a programmer.

## 3. Do you think there are many Chinese that can sing?

1. From my perspective as someone who grew up in a small Wenzhou village and now works in a big city, I'd say there's an abundance of singing talent in China. Our rich musical tradition, from folk songs to modern pop, has cultivated a strong appreciation for vocal arts. However, what's truly impressive is how this talent extends beyond professional circles; I've heard incredible voices at everything from local festivals to company karaoke nights.

2. As a programmer who often deals with data and statistics, I'd say the sheer population size of China suggests there must be a significant number of talented singers. However, what's more interesting is the cultural emphasis on music and performance, which encourages many people to develop their singing skills. From my observations, even in tech-centric environments, it's common to find colleagues who are surprisingly good singers.

3. While it's difficult to quantify, I believe China has a wealth of singing talent that often goes unrecognized on the global stage. Growing up, I witnessed how singing was integral to our community life, from traditional opera performances to casual gatherings where everyone would join in. This widespread engagement with music, coupled with the increasing accessibility of vocal training resources online, suggests to me that there are indeed many Chinese who can sing well.

4. In my experience transitioning from a rural upbringing to a career in technology, I've encountered numerous individuals with impressive singing abilities across various walks of life. What's particularly noteworthy is the diversity of styles, from traditional Chinese opera to modern pop and even Western classical music. This versatility, I believe, is a testament to the adaptability and musical aptitude of many Chinese people.

5. As someone who enjoys both logic-based activities like coding and creative pursuits like singing, I've noticed that many of my Chinese colleagues and friends possess a similar duality. This balance often translates into a surprising level of singing proficiency, even among those in technical fields. While not everyone may be a professional-level singer, the general standard is quite high, reflecting a culture that values musical expression alongside academic and professional achievements.
