## What apps have you recently used?
- Well, like everyone else, I've been using social media networks, like WeChat and Weibo<b><u>, on a daily basis to communicate with friends </u></b>and <b><u>keep up-to-date with what is happening around the world</u></b> at the moment. <b><u>Apart from that</u></b>, a meditation app called  CALM, in particular, occupies the half-hour before my bedtime.
## What kinds of apps are you usually interested in?
- I would say apps with the aim of improving efficiency, among  others, are my favorite. By simply creating to-do lists and memos on my smartphone, a weekly, monthly or even yearly schedule would be made. Then notifications will be popped up automatically to remind me of what to do next. Thanks to that, I would neither <b><u>mess up my work</u></b> nor be panic ever!
## What was the first app you used?
- If my memory serves me right, the first app I used was a mathematics game. That app is not only entertaining but also educational. It helped me to improve my academic performance pretty much, particularly in maths.
## What kinds of apps would you like to use in the future?
- I guess my future preferences is health-tracking apps. Because of the<b><u> increasing risk of physical as well as mental health problems</u></b>, I want to monitor my health, checking on with an app to make sure that everything from my diet to my<b><u> workout regimen</u></b> is on track.
