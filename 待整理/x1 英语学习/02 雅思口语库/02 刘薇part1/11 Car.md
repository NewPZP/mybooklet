## Did you enjoy traveling by car when you were a kid?
- Yes absolutely. <b><u>I have to say that I've been a big fan of car trips</u></b> even when I could barely walk. Back then, I was kept in the baby car seat and traveled to many neighboring cities with my parents. And those experiences have definitely broadened my horizon <b><u>and more importantly</u></b> created a lot of wonderful memories for my family.
## What types of cars do you like?
- I am fascinated by sports cars, especially those with aerodynamic shape and powerful engines. Those cars are undeniably modern industry miracles that have<b><u> perfectly integrated cutting-edge technology</u></b> and <b><u>avant-grade designing</u></b>. To own such a vehicle has been motivating me to work harder. 
## Do you prefer to be a driver a passenger?
- For most of the cases when I have the choice, I'd happily choose to hold the wheel and be the driver. To drive can absolutely bring me more fun than to simply sit as a good boy in the back seat. Either to step on the throttle or to shift from low to high gear can make me feel that I'm having a powerful machine under my own control. Being a passenger sound less exciting, and I do get carsick occasionally.

## What do you usually do when there is a traffic jam?
- <b><u>As soon as I notice a traffic jam is about to happen</u></b>, <b><u>my first instinct is to</u></b> launch the navigation app on my phone and see if there's an alternative route with less traffic. This, however, doesn't always work out here in Beijing, so I would finally try to give more patience and drive with greater care, as accidents tend to happen more easily in such cases.
