## Do you like to write by hand?
- Not really any more. These days I find myself typing a lot on computers and texting on my phone, so I rarely use paper and a pen anymore. That said, I still have to jot down notes in class because laptops are not allowed in classroom. I think it's a pain, really.
## Is your handwriting easy to read?
- Unfortunately no, especially when I write in cursive. I remember when I was a primary school student, my Chinese teacher often put some red marks on or question marks on my composition simply because my penmanship was illegible. There days, I've been putting so much effort just to improve my handwriting because I consider the Chinese character as a rare art form.
## Which do you prefer, writing by hand or typing?
- It depends. When writing about everyday things or practicing for the IELTS test, I'd rather write by hand. I believe writing something down is an efficient way to memorize things. I only use my laptop to write academic reports as it is more convenient to edit and revise the assignment.
## What is the difference between handwriting and typing?
- With handwriting, there is nothing called erasing. What's written is written and the only thing you can do is cutting it. Writing in this way is more real and there is only one genuine copy fore everything written. However, with a keyboard, you can just type down what ever you want to and editing becomes so much easier with it. Also, you can delete any data without a trace quite quickly.
