## What kinds of TV programmes do you often watch?
- I watch adventure programmes <b><u>more often than other kind.</u></b> Being a student, I don't have so many opportunities to explore the wilderness or get close to the wildlife in person. The adventure programmes, like Man VS Wild by Bear Grylls, can bring me  a safer and more intriguing access to a different life experience.
## Do you think kids are watching too much television?
- No, absolutely not. In stead of watching TV, most of the children are spending<b><u> an incredible amount of time</u></b> browsing short video apps, <b><u>which is indeed something</u></b> to worry about. I'd rather the children could watch more TV, as there are more accredited an and censored programmes, which can be less misleading and perhaps more educational.

## What are the impacts of watching TV programmes on children?
- Watching TV could be a significant channel for children to acquire information and <b><u>form their own opinion of society</u></b>, as there are both educational and entertaining programmes on TV. There are surely concerns about <b><u>the influences of violent elements</u></b>, but I believe with proper parental guidance, the children would not<b><u> imitate recklessly</u></b>.

## What kinds of TV programmes do you think should be broadcast more?
- I would undoubtedly love to see more programmes that I love to be broadcast more, like adventure shows, But considering the better future of our society, I would also suggest that we can try to produce more programmes that advocate good deeds, higher moral standars and common dreams for the entire human race, so that TV viewers can kill the time while receiving more food for thought, which is specially beneficial to the young generation.
