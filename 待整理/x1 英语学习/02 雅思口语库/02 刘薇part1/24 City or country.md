## Do you live in a city or a village?
- I live in Beijing, which is <b><u>a cosmopolitan city</u></b> in northern China. Beijing is a city that <b><u>provides both rewarding working opportunities and amusing entertainment facilities</u></b>. The only problem is that the housing price is crazily high, which places a heavy economic burden on every household.

## Do Chinese people like to living in cities?
- <b><u>I guess for most of us, the answer should be yes</u></b>. Cities can <b><u>unquestionably provide better resources in terms of both work and life</u></b>.  <b><u>Meanwhile</u></b>, living in rural areas would often mean to<b><u> face numerous inconveniences</u></b>, <b><u>especially when it comes to</u></b> education and health care, which are quite valued in our culture. But <b><u>we can't ignore the phenomenon that </u></b>there young people moving to the villages for a better and more <b><u>idyllic natural environment</u></b>.
## What's the last city you visited?
- It's Sanya, an amazingly beautiful city located in the south of China. I went there last winter, because <b><u>it's an ideal resort</u></b> for the northerners to<b><u> get away from the freezing winters.</u></b> I have to say that's a wonderful place for vacations, besides the coastal sceneries and the tropical food, there are also some of the best hotels along the beach.
## Which city do you want to live in the future?
- <b><u>I guess Sanya should be among my favorite choices</u></b>, as<b><u> I've been fascinated by it</u></b> the first time I visited it. Though located in the furthest southern part of China, the city has a perfectly harmonious combination of the cultures all over the country. <b><u>With the admirably pleasant climate,</u></b> Sanya is absolutely a great place to live in.
