## Do you like watching sports programs on TV?
- Yes, <b><u>whenever</u></b> there are sports matches<b><u>, I become a couch potato</u></b>. I have <b><u>always been a fan of</u></b> almost all kinds of sports except sports like boxing and wrestling because I find these sports to be a lit too violent for me.
## Do you like to watch live sports games?
- Were I to make a choice between watching a live game or watching it on the spot, I would most probably choose the former. So that I can enjoy it in whichever position I feel comfortable with, like sitting on the floor or lying in my sofa.<b><u> The best part is that </u></b>I can have the best view for free, <b><u>as there are the camera crew working hard to capture the most impressive moments of the game</u></b>.
## Who do you like to watch sports games with?
- Although I enjoy watching sports games with my family<b><u> since it is a good way to strengthen family ties</u></b>,<b><u> spending time with my friends it still my top option</u></b>, because I can do different things such as drinking with my friends than I do with my family. This must be incredible fun.

## What kinds of games do you expect to watch in the future?
- The sports game I hope to watch is basketball. The main reason is that it's a team sport, which provides more opportunities for us to learn meaningful things such as<b><u> responsibility, unity, teamwork and bravery.</u></b>
