## Do you like science?
- I do find science <b><u>intriguing</u></b> because there is so much one can comprehend about the present life from science, which makes life more vivid for individuals. For example, I know the reason why liquid flows and rose are red. Besides, it never ends, which means there is always something new to discover because the topics of science are so huge.
## What did you start to learn about science?
- <b><u>Like most people</u></b>, I started learning about science in elementary school. The first thing l learned about is magnets. The teacher showed us how magnets could attract and repel each other. I remember that it was really fun to play around with magnets and feel the magnetic force between then.
## Which science subject do you find interesting?
- Chemistry has been my favorite subject because it taught me about our surroundings. Surely biology was even more interesting but the difficult terms it presented  were not something that fascinated me. The greatest lesson anyone can ever learn from chemistry is that mixing is essential but one must remember that it can be both constructive and destructive.
## Have you done anything interesting with science?
- I have done a number of different experiments with science.<b><u> If my memory serves me well</u></b>, once I made a food science project to transform drinks into semi-solid balls that pop in my mouth. The technique is called spherification and it is part of a larger food science trend called molecular gastronomy - but we just called it yummy science!
