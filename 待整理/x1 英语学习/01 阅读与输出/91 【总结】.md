### 📖 四、示例回答（节选）

**Q: Do you have any daily routines?**  
A: Yes, I do. I usually get up around 6:30 a.m. and start my day with some light exercise like jogging or stretching. It helps me stay energetic. After that, I have a quick breakfast and spend over an hour commuting to work. During my lunch break, I often practice English for about an hour.

**Q: Are there any habits you wish to develop?**  
A: I'd like to develop the habit of reading more regularly. I believe it would help me improve my language skills and broaden my thinking. If I had more free time, I’d also love to pick up a musical instrument like guitar.

**Q: Do you enjoy trying new things or sticking to your habits?**  
A: I think both are important. Sticking to good habits keeps me productive and organized, but trying new things helps me grow and stay open-minded. I try to keep a balance between the two.
